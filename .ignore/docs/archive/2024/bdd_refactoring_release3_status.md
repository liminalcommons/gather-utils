## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current Status |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Project planning completion | 100% | 100% |
| Architecture design completion | 100% | 70% |
| Traceability model implementation | 100% | 15% |

2. **Develop Core Traceability Services**: Implement the core database and API services for traceability
   - Target completion: End of Week 4
   - Owner: Backend Development Team

3. **Implement First Requirements Connector**: Develop and test integration with primary requirements system
   - Target completion: End of Week 6
   - Owner: Integration Team

4. **Create Prototype Dashboard**: Implement initial version of coverage dashboard
   - Target completion: End of Week 7
   - Owner: Frontend Development Team

## Risks and Issues

| Risk/Issue | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation/Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| Limited access to requirements system APIs | High | High | Initiated discussions with system owners, exploring alternative access methods |
| Complexity of bidirectional synchronization | High | Medium | Breaking down into smaller components, implementing robust conflict resolution |
| Resource constraints for CI/CD integration | Medium | Medium | Prioritizing most impactful integrations first, exploring simplified approaches |
| Performance concerns with large datasets | Medium | Medium | Implementing pagination, caching, and optimized queries in data model design |

## Timeline Update

The project is currently in Week 1 of the planned 12-week schedule. Initial planning and architecture activities are on track, with development activities beginning on schedule.

**Estimated completion:** We anticipate completing the release on schedule by the end of Week 12, though the scope of the requirements system integrations may be adjusted based on access and complexity discovered during development.

## Dependencies and Blockers

**Dependencies:**
- Access to requirements management system APIs (awaiting approval)
- Completion of Release 2 feature consolidation (in progress)
- DevOps support for CI/CD integration (committed for Weeks 9-12)

**Blockers:**
- None currently identified

## Resources and Support

- **Documentation**: Requirements and architecture documents are available in the `docs/project/release3/` directory
- **Prototypes**: Initial prototypes are available in the `prototypes/traceability/` directory
- **Support**: Questions and issues can be directed to the BDD Refactoring Team

## Conclusion

Release 3 is progressing according to plan, with solid foundations being established for the traceability framework. The project team has completed initial planning and architecture design activities, and development work is beginning on schedule. Key challenges have been identified around requirements system integration, and the team is actively working on mitigation strategies. Overall, the project remains on track for completion within the planned 12-week timeframe.
