| Identify duplicate/overlapping features | ✅ Complete | Run duplication analyzer tool | - `tools/bdd_duplication_analyzer.py` exists and operational<br>- Initial analysis completed |

## Release 2: Feature Consolidation & Organization

### Status: IN PROGRESS (65%)

| Scope Item | Status | Verification Method | Evidence |
|------------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Implement feature merge strategy | ⏳ In Progress (60%) | Check tool functionality and results | - `tools/bdd_feature_consolidator.py` exists<br>- Initial consolidations completed |
| Resolve "generated_" vs original files | ⏳ In Progress (40%) | Check repository for remaining generated files | - Tool exists but full implementation pending |
| Define feature categories | ✅ Complete | Check category documentation | - Categories defined in consolidation strategy |
| Create directory structure | ✅ Complete | Verify physical directory structure | - New directory structure implemented |
| Migrate features to categories | ⏳ In Progress (30%) | Check feature locations in new structure | - Initial migrations started<br>- Dependency issues being resolved |
| Verify no regressions | 🔄 Ongoing | Run full test suite after each migration | - Continuous verification in progress |

## Release 3: Traceability Enhancement

### Status: PLANNING (10%)

| Scope Item | Status | Verification Method | Evidence |
|------------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Implement traceability matrix | ⏳ Planning | Check matrix implementation | - Initial design complete<br>- Implementation not started |
| Map requirements to scenarios | ⏳ Planning | Verify mapping completeness | - Requirements identified<br>- Mapping not started |
| Identify coverage gaps | ⏳ Planning | Run coverage analysis | - Tool design in progress |
| Define release validation criteria | ⏳ Planning | Check validation documentation | - Initial criteria drafted |
| Separate process vs product features | ⏳ Planning | Check feature categorization | - Categorization planned |

## Release 4: CI/CD Integration

### Status: EARLY PLANNING (5%)

| Scope Item | Status | Verification Method | Evidence |
|------------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Implement automated coverage reporting | 🚫 Not Started | Check CI/CD pipeline | - Initial requirements gathered |
| Establish BDD-driven release sign-off | 🚫 Not Started | Check release process docs | - Concept defined |
| Implement requirements verification | 🚫 Not Started | Check verification system | - Requirements gathering in progress |
| Update documentation references | 🚫 Not Started | Check documentation updates | - Pending implementation |
| Update Definition of Done | 🚫 Not Started | Check DoD document | - Pending implementation |

## Release 5: Agent System Improvements

### Status: PARTIALLY STARTED (20%)

| Scope Item | Status | Verification Method | Evidence |
|------------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Update agent guidelines | ✅ Complete | Check guidelines document | - `.cursor/rules/agent_guidelines.mdc` updated |
| Create BDD-specific agent guidelines | ✅ Complete | Check BDD guidelines | - `.cursor/rules/bdd_agent_guidelines.mdc` created |
| Implement agent BDD helper tool | 🚫 Not Started | Check tool existence | - Planned for future implementation |
| Create BDD templates for agents | 🚫 Not Started | Check template existence | - Planned for future implementation |
| Create agent operations cookbook | 🚫 Not Started | Check cookbook existence | - Planned for future implementation |

## Verification Methods

For each scope item, the following verification methods should be used:

1. **Documentation Verification**
   ```bash
   python tools/repo_health_check.py --validate-docs
   ```

2. **Tool Functionality**
   ```bash
   python tools/run_bdd_tests.py --tags=REQ-TOOL
   ```

3. **Feature Migration**
   ```bash
   python tools/bdd_migration_validator.py
   ```

4. **Coverage Analysis**
   ```bash
   python tools/bdd_coverage_report.py
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Release 2 Completion**
   - Focus on resolving dependency issues in feature migration
   - Complete consolidation of remaining features
   - Verify all migrations with comprehensive testing

2. **Release 3 Preparation**
   - Complete detailed design of traceability framework
   - Begin implementation of core traceability services
   - Develop first requirements system connector

3. **Continuous Verification**
   - Regular execution of verification methods
   - Documentation of results and issues
   - Tracking of progress metrics
