# Gather-Utils Project Continuation Context

## Current Status

- **Overall Project Status**: Active Development
- **Current Focus**: Repository Organization, BDD Implementation, TDD Integration
- **BDD Refactoring Initiative**: Release 2 (Feature Consolidation & Directory Structure) - ~70% complete
- **Repository Health**: All 38 tools have valid metadata

## Recent Accomplishments

- Repository health check passing with all tools having valid metadata
- Created utils directory and common modules for BDD step definitions
- Created utility tools to fix import dependencies in BDD step files
- Standardized import patterns for step definition files
- Created central imports file and common steps modules for reuse

## Current Context

The project is currently focusing on two major initiatives:

1. **Portal Explorer Product Development**: Building and enhancing the core product for exploring Gather.town spaces.
2. **BDD Refactoring Initiative**: Currently in Release 2 (Feature Consolidation & Directory Structure) at ~70% completion.

To address import dependencies in step definition files, we have:
1. Created a centralized utils directory with common imports and utilities
2. Implemented a registry to track and manage step definitions
3. Created common step definition modules for reuse
4. Developed tools to fix relative imports and standardize imports

The next step is to apply these changes to the actual step definition files and validate that the BDD tests still pass.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Apply Import Fixes to Step Definition Files**:
   - Run the bdd_import_fixer.py tool on all step definition files
   - Replace direct imports from common step modules with imports from utils/common_steps.py

2. **Test and Validate the Changes**:
   - Run BDD tests to ensure all tests still pass
   - Fix any issues that arise from the import changes

3. **Continue Manual Consolidation of High-Priority Features**:
   - Focus on one domain at a time (e.g., portal, cli, etc.)
   - Use the new import structure to facilitate consolidation
   - Thoroughly test after each consolidation

4. **Address Linting and Code Style Issues**:
   - Run tools/fix_style_issues.py to identify and resolve issues
   - Update pre-commit hooks for automated checking

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Complete BDD Refactoring Release 2**:
   - Update all feature files with proper tags
   - Complete consolidation across all feature categories
   - Validate and test consolidated features

2. **Enhance TDD Workflow Integration**:
   - Complete TDD lifecycle management framework
   - Integrate TDD and BDD workflows

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - Complete documentation updates
   - Update BDD conventions with real examples
   - Create directory structure navigation guides

## Reference Files

- **Project Status**: docs/project/PROJECT_STATUS.md
- **BDD Refactoring Status**: docs/archive/2024/bdd_refactoring_release2_status.md
- **Agent Guidelines**: .cursor/rules/agent_guidelines.mdc, .cursor/rules/bdd_agent_guidelines.mdc
- **BDD Structure**: tests/bdd/features/ (organized by domain)
- **Tools**: tools/ directory (especially BDD tools for refactoring)
- **New BDD Utils**: tests/bdd/utils/ directory with common modules and step definitions
- **Import Fixer Tool**: tools/bdd_import_fixer.py for fixing import dependencies

## Open Questions

1. What is the priority order for feature consolidation across domains?
2. What is the specific plan for TDD Phase 1 and 2 implementation?
3. How to handle archived test files like test_debug_map_objects_archived.py?
4. Should the BDD step registry be integrated with behave and pytest-bdd frameworks?

This continuation context will be updated at the end of each work session to provide seamless transitions between work sessions and maintain project momentum.
