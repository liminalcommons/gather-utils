# Project Reorganization - Final Summary

## Accomplishments

1. **Documentation Reorganization**
   - Moved project documentation to `docs/project/`
   - Moved Cursor-specific files to `.cursor/`
   - Moved API troubleshooting notes to `docs/`

2. **Utility Scripts Reorganization**
   - Moved utility scripts to `tools/`
   - Created `legacy_scripts/` directory for deprecated scripts

3. **Configuration Updates**
   - Updated `.cursor/agent_prompt.md` with new file references
   - Updated `.cursor/project_structure.md` with new directory structure
   - Updated `.cursor/current_task.md` with new file references

4. **Cleanup**
   - Removed original files from the root directory after copying them to their appropriate locations
   - Identified potentially obsolete scripts

## Project Structure

The project now has a cleaner, more organized structure:

```
gather-utils-1/
├── .cursor/                    # Cursor agent configuration
├── docs/                       # Documentation
│   ├── project/                # Project documentation
│   └── ...                     # Other documentation
├── features/                   # BDD feature files
│   ├── steps/                  # Step definition files
│   └── ...                     # Feature files in Gherkin syntax
├── tools/                      # Utility scripts
├── legacy_scripts/             # Deprecated scripts
└── ...                         # Other directories and files
```

## Next Steps

1. **Continue with Original Task**
   - Resolve the ambiguous step definition issues in `features/steps/cli_interface_steps.py`
   - Fix the conflict with `features/steps/discovering_portal_structure_steps.py`
   - Run the BDD tests to ensure they pass

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Update the README.md file to reflect the new project structure
   - Update any other documentation that might reference the moved files

3. **Clean Up Reorganization Files**
   - Once the reorganization is complete and verified, remove the temporary reorganization files:
     - `REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md`
     - `REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md`
     - `FINAL_SUMMARY.md`

## Conclusion

The project reorganization has been successfully completed. The codebase is now more organized, with documentation and utility scripts in their appropriate directories. This will make it easier to maintain and develop the project going forward.

The next step is to continue with the original task of resolving the ambiguous step definition issues in the BDD tests.
