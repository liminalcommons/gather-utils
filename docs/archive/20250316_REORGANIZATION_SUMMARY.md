## Files to Review

Some files mentioned in the original plan were not found in the root directory. They may have been moved or deleted previously:
- `test_release0.py` - Not found in the root directory
- `test_api_connection.py` - Not found in the root directory

## Next Steps

1. Delete the original files from the root directory now that they've been copied to their appropriate locations:
   - `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
   - `TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`
   - `BDD_TEST_STATUS.md`
   - `CURSOR_DEVELOPMENT_CONTEXT.md`
   - `RESUMPTION_PROMPT.md`
   - `findings.md`
   - `debug_map_objects.py`
   - `check_env.py`
   - `debug_env.py`
   - `download_maps.py`

2. Run BDD tests to ensure functionality is not affected by the reorganization:
   ```bash
   behave features/command_line_interface.feature --format pretty
   ```

3. Continue with the original task of resolving ambiguous step definitions in the command_line_interface_steps.py file.
