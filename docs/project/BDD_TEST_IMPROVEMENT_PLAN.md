# BDD Test Improvement Plan

## Issue Summary

During the implementation of the development system improvement initiative, we identified that our BDD tests are being skipped rather than executed. When running BDD tests with specific tags, we consistently see output like:

```
0 features passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped
0 scenarios passed, 0 failed, 25 skipped
0 steps passed, 0 failed, 150 skipped, 0 undefined
```

This indicates that while our implementation may meet the requirements, it's not being properly validated by the tests. This document outlines a plan to address this issue.

## Root Cause Analysis

There are several potential causes for this issue:

1. **Tag Configuration**: The tags used in the feature files might not match the tags used in the test runner command.
2. **Step Implementation**: The step definitions might not be properly implemented or might be in the wrong location.
3. **Environment Setup**: The test environment might not be properly configured to run the BDD tests.
4. **Feature File Structure**: The feature files might not be structured correctly for the test runner to recognize them.
5. **Test Runner Configuration**: The test runner might be configured to skip certain tests or might not be configured to run the tests with the specified tags.

## Action Plan

### 1. Investigate Tag Configuration

- Review the tags used in the feature files
- Compare them with the tags used in the test runner command
- Ensure that the tags are consistent and properly formatted

### 2. Review Step Implementation

- Check that all step definitions are properly implemented
- Verify that the step definitions are in the correct location
- Ensure that the step definitions match the steps in the feature files

### 3. Verify Environment Setup

- Check that the test environment is properly configured
- Verify that all required dependencies are installed
- Ensure that the test runner is properly configured

### 4. Examine Feature File Structure

- Review the structure of the feature files
- Ensure that they follow the correct format for the test runner
- Verify that the feature files are in the correct location

### 5. Test Runner Configuration

- Review the configuration of the test runner
- Check for any settings that might cause tests to be skipped
- Ensure that the test runner is properly configured to run tests with the specified tags

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Investigation Phase** (1-2 days)
   - Analyze the current state of the BDD tests
   - Identify the root cause of the issue

2. **Planning Phase** (1 day)
   - Develop a detailed plan to address the root cause
   - Identify any dependencies or prerequisites

3. **Implementation Phase** (2-3 days)
   - Make the necessary changes to fix the issue
   - Test the changes to ensure they resolve the issue

4. **Verification Phase** (1-2 days)
   - Run the BDD tests to verify that they now execute properly
   - Document the changes made and the results

## Success Criteria

- BDD tests execute rather than skip
- Test results show actual pass/fail status rather than skipped
- All tests pass, indicating that our implementation meets the requirements
- The test runner output shows the number of features, scenarios, and steps that passed, failed, or were skipped

## Responsible Team Members

- Developer: [TBD]
- Reviewer: [TBD]
- Tester: [TBD]

## Documentation Updates

Once the issue is resolved, the following documentation should be updated:

- PROJECT_STATUS.md: Remove the known issue related to BDD test execution
- README.md: Update the testing section to reflect the fixed BDD tests
- Any other relevant documentation that mentions the BDD tests

## Conclusion

Fixing the BDD test execution issue is critical to ensure that our implementation is properly validated. This plan outlines the steps needed to address the issue and ensure that our BDD tests provide meaningful validation of our code.
