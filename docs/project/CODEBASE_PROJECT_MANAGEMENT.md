# Codebase Project Lifecycle Management

This document outlines the best practices for managing the lifecycle of codebase projects, including features, products, and bug fixes. It provides a structured approach to planning, executing, and tracking projects that enhance our product capabilities and user experience.

## Codebase vs. Development System Projects

Codebase projects differ fundamentally from development system projects. For detailed comparison, see the [Development System Project Management](./DEV_SYSTEM_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md) document. In summary:

Codebase projects:
- Focus on **what** we build (features, products, bug fixes)
- Primarily impact end-user experience and product capabilities
- Are measured by user value, product performance, and business outcomes
- Involve end users, product management, and business stakeholders
- Deliver direct business and user value

## Project Lifecycle Overview

Codebase projects typically follow this lifecycle:

```
┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
│ Definition │────>│   Design   │────>│Implementation│────>│  Validation │
│ & Planning │     │            │     │             │     │ & Release   │
└────────────┘     └────────────┘     └────────────┘     └────────────┘
```

### 1. Definition & Planning Phase
- Define user requirements
- Create user stories
- Establish acceptance criteria
- Define scope and timeline
- Identify dependencies
- Allocate resources

### 2. Design Phase
- Create technical design
- Define data models
- Design user interfaces
- Define API contracts
- Review with stakeholders
- Plan implementation strategy

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Develop features (TDD approach)
- Implement user interfaces
- Write automated tests
- Conduct code reviews
- Address technical debt
- Document changes

### 4. Validation & Release Phase
- Conduct user acceptance testing
- Perform regression testing
- Complete documentation
- Train support teams
- Deploy to production
- Monitor post-release metrics

## Project Documentation

Every codebase project should have two key documents:

### 1. Project Brief
A comprehensive plan that outlines:
- Project overview and background
- User requirements and stories
- Technical approach
- Success criteria and metrics
- Project timeline
- Resources and responsibilities
- Dependencies and constraints
- Testing approach

Use the [Codebase Project Brief Template](../templates/codebase_project_template.md).

### 2. Status Tracking Document
A living document that tracks:
- Current progress
- User story status
- Key metrics
- Recent updates
- Decisions log
- Timeline history
- Risk status

Use the [Codebase Project Status Template](../templates/codebase_status_template.md).

## Project Planning

### Project Initiation Checklist
- [ ] Identify the user need or business opportunity
- [ ] Define core user stories and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Estimate development effort and complexity
- [ ] Define success metrics tied to business outcomes
- [ ] Identify stakeholders and secure their commitment
- [ ] Determine resources required
- [ ] Establish preliminary timeline
- [ ] Create project brief using template
- [ ] Set up status tracking document
- [ ] Schedule kickoff meeting

### User Story Guidelines

Each user story should be:
- **User-focused**: Described from the user's perspective
- **Valuable**: Delivers clear value to users
- **Sized appropriately**: Completable within a sprint
- **Testable**: Has clear acceptance criteria
- **Independent**: Minimal dependencies on other stories

Format:
```
As a [user type],
I want [capability],
So that [benefit].

Acceptance Criteria:
1. [Criterion 1]
2. [Criterion 2]
3. [Criterion 3]
```

## Status Tracking

### Status Update Frequency
- **Daily**: Team updates story status in standups
- **Weekly**: Project lead updates status document
- **Bi-weekly**: Status report to stakeholders
- **Per Sprint**: Comprehensive status review and demo

### Progress Tracking
- Use story boards or tracking tools
- Track velocity and burndown
- Update release forecasts based on actual progress
- Document blockers and dependencies
- Record decisions and their rationale

### Key Performance Indicators
Typical KPIs for codebase projects:
- User story completion
- Defect rates
- Test coverage
- User satisfaction metrics
- Performance measurements
- Business metrics impacted by the project

## User Validation

### User Testing Approach
1. **Early Testing**: Test concepts and prototypes
2. **Iterative Testing**: Validate features during development
3. **Acceptance Testing**: Verify completed features
4. **Beta Testing**: Test with real users before launch
5. **Post-Release Validation**: Monitor usage and gather feedback

### User Feedback Management
- Collect feedback systematically
- Categorize by type and priority
- Link to specific user stories
- Track resolution
- Close the feedback loop with users

## Decision Management

### Decision-Making Process
1. **Identify**: Define the decision needed
2. **Analyze**: Gather information and alternatives
3. **Evaluate**: Assess options against criteria
4. **Decide**: Select the best option with stakeholders
5. **Document**: Record decision, rationale, and impact
6. **Communicate**: Inform all affected parties
7. **Implement**: Put the decision into action

### Decision Log
Maintain a decision log in the status document with:
- Date of decision
- Description of decision
- Alternatives considered
- Rationale for selection
- User/business impact
- Stakeholders involved

## Risk Management

### Risk Identification
Identify risks in these categories:
- Technical risks
- User adoption risks
- Business impact risks
- Resource risks
- Timeline risks
- Integration risks

### Risk Assessment Matrix
Assess risks using impact and likelihood:

| Impact | Low Likelihood | Medium Likelihood | High Likelihood |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| High   | Medium Risk    | High Risk         | High Risk       |
| Medium | Low Risk       | Medium Risk       | High Risk       |
| Low    | Low Risk       | Low Risk          | Medium Risk     |

### Risk Mitigation
For each risk:
1. Develop mitigation strategy
2. Assign ownership
3. Set trigger conditions
4. Define contingency plans
5. Track status in status document

## Project Closure

### Closure Checklist

- [ ] Documentation completed (user, technical, support)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance criteria met
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Support teams trained
- [ ] Post-release monitoring in place
- [ ] Lessons learned documented
- [ ] Project retrospective conducted

### Lessons Learned
Document lessons learned for future projects:
- What worked well
- What challenges were encountered
- How challenges were overcome
- What would be done differently
- Recommendations for future projects

## Templates and Tools

### Project Templates
- [Codebase Project Brief Template](../templates/codebase_project_template.md)

3. **Quality Focus**:
   - Practice TDD and BDD
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Perform regular code reviews
   - Address technical debt proactively

   - Make status visible to all stakeholders
   - Raise issues early
   - Document decisions and rationale
   - Share progress and demos regularly

5. **Continuous Improvement**:
