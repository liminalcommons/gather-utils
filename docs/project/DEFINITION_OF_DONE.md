# Definition of Done (DoD)

This document defines the criteria that must be met for work to be considered "Done" at various levels of the project. It integrates both Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) approaches.

## Feature Level DoD

A feature is considered "Done" when:

### Requirements & Documentation
- [ ] Feature is described in a BDD feature file with clear scenarios in Gherkin syntax
- [ ] Technical design decisions are documented
- [ ] User documentation is updated (if applicable)
- [ ] API documentation is updated (if applicable)
- [ ] All new documentation includes proper metadata headers following DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md
- [ ] Documentation lifecycle and obsolescence conditions are defined
- [ ] Existing documentation has been updated to reflect changes
- [ ] Documentation formats follow project standards

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- [ ] Unit tests are written for all new components/functions
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Unit test coverage meets minimum threshold (80%)
- [ ] Edge cases are covered by unit tests
- [ ] Mocks/stubs are used appropriately for external dependencies

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- [ ] Step definitions are implemented for all BDD scenarios
- [ ] All BDD scenarios pass
- [ ] Step definitions are properly organized with minimal duplication
- [ ] BDD tests verify end-to-end functionality from a user perspective

### Code Quality
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Code passes all linter checks
- [ ] No new technical debt is introduced (or it's documented)
- [ ] Code is refactored for clarity and maintainability
- [ ] No code smells (duplicate code, overly complex methods, etc.)

### Tool Development
- [ ] All new tools include complete metadata headers following standards in TOOL_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md
- [ ] Tool purpose and lifecycle are clearly documented
- [ ] Obsolescence conditions are defined
- [ ] Tools developed for one-off tasks have a documented cleanup plan
- [ ] Tool dependencies are explicitly listed

### Lifecycle Management
- [ ] All artifacts include appropriate lifecycle metadata following relevant standards:
  - Code components: Creation date, status, last validated date
  - Documentation: Title, creation date, status, purpose, audience, lifecycle stages
  - Tools: Complete metadata header with status and obsolescence conditions
  - BDD artifacts: Status, creation date, last validated date
  - Project artifacts: Status, completion criteria, timeline
- [ ] Status is accurately reflected (Draft, Active, Deprecated, or Archived)
- [ ] Obsolescence conditions are clearly defined
- [ ] Dependencies on other artifacts are documented
- [ ] Changes to lifecycle status are documented in commit messages
- [ ] Related artifacts are updated to reflect new or changed artifacts
- [ ] Obsolete artifacts are properly deprecated or archived

### Review & Integration
- [ ] Code has been peer-reviewed
- [ ] Code has been merged into the main branch
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes (all tests, linting, etc.)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Sprint/Iteration Level DoD

A sprint/iteration is considered "Done" when:

- [ ] All features planned for the sprint meet the Feature Level DoD
- [ ] Test coverage report shows maintained or improved coverage
- [ ] Technical debt has been addressed according to sprint goals
- [ ] Project documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] BDD test status document is updated
- [ ] Retrospective is conducted and action items are documented

## Release Level DoD

A release is considered "Done" when:

- [ ] All features for the release meet the Feature Level DoD
- [ ] Integration testing across all components is complete
- [ ] Performance testing meets defined thresholds
- [ ] Security testing is complete with no critical issues
- [ ] User acceptance testing is complete
- [ ] Release notes are prepared
- [ ] Deployment plan is documented
- [ ] Rollback plan is documented

## TDD Workflow

For each new component or function:

1. **Red**: Write a failing unit test that defines the expected behavior
2. **Green**: Implement the minimal code necessary to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping the tests passing

## BDD Workflow

For each user-facing feature:

1. **Define**: Create a feature file with scenarios in Gherkin syntax
2. **Implement**: Develop step definitions that connect to the application code
3. **Verify**: Run BDD tests to ensure the feature works as expected from a user perspective

## DoD Verification Checklist

To verify that a feature meets the Definition of Done:

```markdown
## Feature: [Feature Name]

### TDD Verification
- [ ] Unit tests written first (Red)
- [ ] Implementation makes tests pass (Green)
- [ ] Code refactored for quality (Refactor)
- [ ] Unit test coverage: ___%
- [ ] Edge cases covered

### BDD Verification
- [ ] All scenarios pass
- [ ] Step definitions properly organized
- [ ] End-to-end functionality verified

### Code Quality Verification
- [ ] Linter passes
- [ ] Style guidelines followed
- [ ] No code smells
- [ ] Peer review completed

### Documentation Verification
- [ ] Technical decisions documented
- [ ] User/API docs updated
- [ ] BDD test status updated
```

## DoD Evolution Process

The Definition of Done is a living document that evolves as our development practices mature. The process for evolving the DoD is as follows:

1. **Identify Improvement Opportunities**: During retrospectives, identify aspects of the DoD that could be improved or clarified.

2. **Propose Changes**: Document proposed changes to the DoD, including rationale and expected benefits.

3. **Review and Approve**: Review proposed changes with the team and stakeholders, and approve changes that will improve quality and efficiency.

4. **Update Documentation**: Update this document with approved changes.

5. **Communicate Changes**: Communicate changes to all team members and ensure understanding.

6. **Apply to New Work**: Apply the updated DoD to all new work going forward.

## Implementation Status

The implementation of this Definition of Done is currently in progress. The following items are being addressed:

1. Setting up the TDD infrastructure (pytest, coverage reporting)
2. Creating unit tests for existing components
3. Integrating TDD practices with existing BDD workflow
4. Updating documentation to reflect the new approach

## Next Steps

- [ ] Configure pytest for unit testing
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting
- [ ] Define minimum code coverage thresholds
- [ ] Create templates for unit tests
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline to include unit tests and coverage reports
