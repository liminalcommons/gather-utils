# Project Status

## Current Status

We have completed all four releases of our development system improvement initiative. The system now has improved documentation, consolidated structure, enhanced automation, and better agent operability. We've also addressed the BDD test execution issue and completed the development system map, which was a pending deliverable from Release 1.

We are now initiating a new BDD Refactoring initiative to improve the structure, consistency, and traceability of our BDD features. This initiative is organized into five releases as detailed in `docs/project/plan-bdd-refactoring.md`.
