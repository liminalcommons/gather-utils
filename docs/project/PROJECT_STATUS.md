# Gather-Utils Project Status

**Last Updated: 2024-03-21**
**Overall Progress: Active Development**
**Current Focus: Repository Organization, BDD Implementation, TDD Integration**

## Executive Summary

This is a living document that tracks the status of the Gather-Utils project. The project provides utilities for working with Gather Town maps, portals, and related functionality, with a focus on robust testing and maintainable code. We follow BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) practices and are implementing enhanced TDD (Test-Driven Development) lifecycle management.

## Current Status

### Major Components Status
