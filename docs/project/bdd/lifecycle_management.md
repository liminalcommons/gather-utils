Last Updated: 2024-03-21
Status: Active
Owner: Development Team
Purpose: Define the lifecycle management of BDD features and step definitions
Audience: Developers, QA Engineers
Lifecycle:
  - Created: To establish clear lifecycle management practices for BDD artifacts
  - Active: Used to guide BDD feature development and maintenance
  - Obsolescence Conditions:
    1. When BDD approach is replaced by a different testing methodology
    2. When specific practices become obsolete due to tooling changes

# BDD Lifecycle Management

This document outlines the lifecycle management practices for BDD features and step definitions.

## Table of Contents

1. [Feature Lifecycle](#feature-lifecycle)
2. [Step Definition Lifecycle](#step-definition-lifecycle)
3. [Validation and Maintenance](#validation-and-maintenance)
4. [Archival Process](#archival-process)
5. [BDD Tools Lifecycle](#bdd-tools-lifecycle)

## Feature Lifecycle

### Feature States

Features in our BDD framework progress through the following states:

1. **Draft**: Initial creation, may be incomplete or unimplemented
2. **Active**: Used in active testing, fully implemented and validated
3. **Deprecated**: Functionality is being phased out or replaced
4. **Archived**: Preserved for historical reference but no longer used

### State Transitions

```
     +--------+
     | Draft  |
     +--------+
         |
         v
     +--------+
     | Active |<------+
     +--------+       |
         |            |
         v            |
  +-----------+       |
  | Deprecated|-------+
  +-----------+   (revived)
         |
         v
    +---------+
    | Archived |
    +---------+
```

### Required Metadata

All feature files must include a metadata header containing:

```gherkin
# Feature Metadata:
# Created: YYYY-MM-DD
# Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
# Status: Draft|Active|Deprecated|Archived
# Owner: Team/Individual
# Lifecycle:
#   - Created: Why this feature was created
#   - Active: Current usage status
#   - Obsolescence Conditions:
#     1. When this feature would be considered obsolete
#     2. Additional condition if applicable
# Last Validated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Step Definition Lifecycle

### Step Definition States

Step definitions follow the same lifecycle states as features:

1. **Draft**: Initial implementation, may need refinement
2. **Active**: Used in active testing, fully implemented and validated
3. **Deprecated**: Steps being phased out or replaced
4. **Archived**: Preserved for reference but no longer used

### Required Metadata

All step definition files must include metadata in their docstrings:

```python
"""
Step definitions for [feature name].

Metadata:
- Created: YYYY-MM-DD
- Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
- Status: Draft|Active|Deprecated|Archived
- Owner: Team/Individual
- Lifecycle:
  - Created: Why these steps were created
  - Active: Current usage status
  - Obsolescence Conditions:
    1. When these steps would be considered obsolete
    2. Additional condition if applicable
- Last Validated: YYYY-MM-DD

Changelog:
- YYYY-MM-DD | Author | Description of change
"""
```

## Validation and Maintenance

### Validation Process

1. **Quarterly Reviews**: Review all BDD features and steps for continued relevance
2. **Validation Updates**: Update "Last Validated" date when confirming continued relevance
3. **Status Updates**: Change status when features move through lifecycle stages

### Validation Tools

```bash
# Validate BDD feature and step metadata
python tools/bdd_validator.py --validate-metadata

# Validate BDD feature implementation status
python tools/bdd_validator.py --validate-implementation

# Generate lifecycle status report
python tools/bdd_validator.py --generate-lifecycle-report
```

### Maintenance Tasks

| Timeframe | Task |
|-----------|------|
| Weekly | Validate implementation status |
| Monthly | Review and update BDD documentation |
| Quarterly | Full lifecycle review of all features |

## Archival Process

When a feature or step definition is no longer needed:

1. **Determination**: Identify features/steps that are obsolete
2. **Documentation**: Update metadata with Deprecated status
3. **Communication**: Inform team of deprecated features
4. **Grace Period**: Allow time for transition (typically 1-2 sprints)
5. **Archival**: Move to archive with Archived status
   
### Archive Location

```
tests/bdd/archive/
├── features/          # Archived feature files
└── steps/             # Archived step definitions
```

## BDD Tools Lifecycle

### Tool Categories

BDD-specific tools in our repository include:

1. **Core BDD Tools**: Essential for everyday BDD work
2. **Analysis Tools**: Used for analyzing BDD implementation
3. **Maintenance Tools**: Used for maintenance and refactoring
4. **One-Off Tools**: Used for specific, time-limited tasks

### Tool Lifecycle Management

1. **Creation**: Document purpose and expected lifecycle
2. **Validation**: Regular review for continued relevance
3. **Archival/Removal**: 
   - Archive tools with reference value
   - Remove tools that serve no future purpose

### Tool Metadata

All BDD tools must include metadata as specified in [TOOL_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md](../TOOL_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Validation**
   - Update "Last Validated" date quarterly
   - Review obsolescence conditions regularly
   - Proactively mark features as Deprecated

2. **Clear Documentation**
   - Document reasons for status changes
   - Maintain changelog entries
   - Document dependencies between features

3. **Proactive Maintenance**
   - Identify and address technical debt
   - Consolidate similar features
   - Refactor step definitions for reuse
