# BDD Feature Consolidation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for consolidating BDD features as part of Release 2 of the BDD refactoring initiative. It provides guidelines for addressing duplicate scenarios, overlapping features, tag inconsistencies, and coverage gaps identified during the analysis phase.

## Objectives

1. Eliminate duplicate and redundant scenarios
2. Consolidate overlapping features
3. Standardize tags across all features
4. Address critical coverage gaps
5. Reorganize feature files according to BDD conventions

## Consolidation Approach

### 1. Addressing Duplicate Scenarios

Duplicate scenarios fall into several categories, each requiring a different approach:

#### Exact Duplicates

For scenarios that are exactly the same:

1. **Identify Primary Location**: Determine the most appropriate feature file for the scenario based on the BDD conventions
2. **Remove Duplicates**: Remove duplicates from other feature files
3. **Ensure Tag Preservation**: Ensure all requirement tags from duplicates are added to the primary scenario
4. **Update Step Definitions**: Update step definitions to reference the new location

**Decision Criteria for Primary Location:**
- Feature file name/purpose matches scenario functionality
- Feature already contains related scenarios
- Feature conforms to BDD conventions
- Feature has appropriate tag coverage

#### Semantic Duplicates

For scenarios that are similar but not identical:

1. **Compare Differences**: Analyze the differences between similar scenarios
2. **Merge Capabilities**: Create a consolidated scenario that captures all functionality
3. **Use Scenario Outlines**: Convert to scenario outlines if differences are mainly in data
4. **Add Comprehensive Tags**: Ensure all requirement tags are included

**Merging Guidelines:**
- Use the clearest, most comprehensive description
- Include steps from all variants unless redundant
- Consider parameterization using Scenario Outlines
- Ensure all requirements are covered

### 2. Consolidating Overlapping Features

Features with overlapping concerns should be reorganized:

1. **Identify Feature Boundaries**: Define clear boundaries between features based on functionality
2. **Group Related Scenarios**: Move scenarios to the feature that best matches their purpose
3. **Maintain Requirement Coverage**: Ensure all requirement tags are preserved
4. **Rename Features**: Ensure feature names clearly reflect their purpose

**Feature Organization Principles:**
- Each feature should have a single, well-defined purpose
- Related scenarios should be grouped together
- Features should be organized according to the directory structure in BDD conventions
- Feature names should follow the naming convention: `[domain]_[functionality].feature`

### 3. Tag Standardization

Tags should be standardized across all features:

1. **Fix Format Issues**: Ensure tags follow the format defined in the BDD conventions
2. **Add Missing Tags**: Add requirement tags to scenarios that lack them
3. **Remove Redundant Tags**: Remove unnecessary or duplicate tags
4. **Standardize Component Tags**: Ensure component tags are consistent

**Tag Standardization Rules:**
- Requirement tags: `@REQ-[domain]-[number]`
- Release tags: `@REL-[number]`
- Component tags: `@[ComponentName]`
- Process tags: `@[ProcessName]`

### 4. Addressing Coverage Gaps

Coverage gaps should be addressed based on priority:

1. **High Risk First**: Address high-risk, high-priority gaps first
2. **Create Missing Scenarios**: Add scenarios for requirements with no coverage
3. **Enhance Partial Coverage**: Enhance scenarios for partially covered requirements
4. **Fix Failing Tests**: Fix failing tests for otherwise covered requirements

**Prioritization Criteria:**
- Risk level (High, Medium, Low)
- Requirement priority (High, Medium, Low)
- Effort required (Low, Medium, High)
- Dependencies with other scenarios

### 5. Feature Reorganization

Feature files should be reorganized according to the BDD conventions:

1. **Directory Structure**: Move features to the appropriate directories
2. **File Naming**: Rename files to follow naming conventions
3. **Internal Structure**: Ensure each feature follows the structure in the conventions
4. **Step Definitions**: Organize step definitions to match feature organization

**Directory Structure:**
```
tests/bdd/
├── features/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── cli/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── process/
│   └── release_plans/
└── steps/
    ├── core/
    ├── cli/
    ├── api/
    ├── models/
    ├── process/
    └── common/
```

## Implementation Process

The consolidation will be implemented in a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Analyze Duplicates Report**: Categorize duplicates and determine consolidation approach
2. **Create Action Items**: Create specific action items for each issue
3. **Develop Test Plan**: Create a test plan to validate changes
4. **Prepare Directory Structure**: Set up the directory structure according to conventions

### Phase 2: Pilot Consolidation

1. **Select Pilot Area**: Choose a subset of features for initial consolidation
2. **Implement Changes**: Apply the consolidation strategy to the pilot area
3. **Validate**: Test that functionality is preserved
4. **Refine Approach**: Adjust the approach based on pilot results

### Phase 3: Full Consolidation

1. **Duplicate Resolution**: Address all duplicate scenarios
2. **Feature Consolidation**: Consolidate overlapping features
3. **Tag Standardization**: Standardize tags across all features
4. **Gap Filling**: Address critical coverage gaps
5. **Reorganization**: Complete the feature reorganization

### Phase 4: Validation and Documentation

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all consolidated features
2. **Update Traceability**: Update the traceability matrix
3. **Document Changes**: Document all changes made
4. **Update Guidelines**: Update BDD guidelines based on lessons learned

## Tool Support

The following tools will be developed to support the consolidation:

1. **Feature Consolidator**: Tool to merge duplicate scenarios
2. **Feature Reorganizer**: Tool to reorganize features according to conventions
3. **Tag Standardizer**: Tool to standardize tags
4. **Template Generator**: Tool to generate new features according to conventions

## Success Criteria

The consolidation will be considered successful when:

1. No exact duplicate scenarios exist
2. All features have clear boundaries and purposes
3. All tags follow standardized formats
4. High-priority coverage gaps are addressed
5. Feature organization follows the BDD conventions
6. All tests pass after consolidation

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Test Breakage**: Risk of breaking existing tests during consolidation
2. **Coverage Loss**: Risk of losing requirement coverage
3. **Team Adoption**: Risk of team resistance to new structure

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Test Breakage**:
   - Comprehensive testing after each change
   - Small, incremental changes
   - Maintain traceability between old and new locations

2. **Coverage Loss**:
   - Regular generation of traceability matrix
   - Validation of requirement coverage
   - Tag preservation during consolidation

3. **Team Adoption**:
   - Clear documentation of changes
   - Training sessions on new structure
   - Tools to assist in following conventions

## Timeline

The consolidation will follow this timeline:

1. **Week 1-2**: Preparation and analysis
2. **Week 3-4**: Pilot consolidation
3. **Week 5-8**: Full consolidation
4. **Week 9-10**: Validation and documentation

## Conclusion

This strategy provides a comprehensive approach to consolidating BDD features. By following this approach, we will address the issues identified in the analysis phase and create a well-structured, maintainable BDD framework that follows our established conventions.
