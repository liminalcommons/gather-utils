# TDD Lifecycle Management Implementation Status

**Last Updated: 2024-03-21**  
**Overall Progress: 25% complete**  
**Current Phase: Analysis & Planning, Documentation & Standards, Tool Development**

## Executive Summary

This is a living document that tracks the status of the TDD Lifecycle Management implementation project. The project aims to enhance our Test-Driven Development practices with comprehensive lifecycle management, similar to our established BDD lifecycle management system.

## Current Phase Status

### Planning Phase
**Progress: 60% complete**

#### Current Activities:
- Initial project plan created
- Status tracking document established
- TDD directory structure created
- Initial documentation drafted
- Validator tool created and tested
- Started retrofitting existing tests with metadata

#### Blockers/Issues:
- None at this time

#### Next Steps:
- Complete the audit of existing TDD artifacts
- Document current TDD practices and gaps
- Enhance repository health checks to validate TDD metadata

### Documentation and Standards Phase
**Progress: 40% complete**

#### Current Activities:
- Basic documentation structure created
- Key documentation files drafted
- Initial templates created
- TDD-BDD integration document created

#### Blockers/Issues:
- None at this time

#### Next Steps:
- Complete documentation files
- Create additional templates as needed
- Update Definition of Done with TDD lifecycle requirements

### Tool Development Phase
**Progress: 30% complete**

#### Current Activities:
- Created TDD validator tool
- Implemented validation for metadata
- Implemented lifecycle report generation
- Fixed validation edge cases

#### Blockers/Issues:
- None at this time

#### Next Steps:
- Extend repo_health_check.py with TDD validation
- Enhance reporting capabilities
- Create retrofit scripts for existing tests

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| TDD artifacts with metadata | 66% | 95% | IN PROGRESS |
| Documentation completeness | 40% | 100% | IN PROGRESS |
| Developer awareness | 0% | 100% | NOT STARTED |
| Obsolete test identification | 0% | 100% | NOT STARTED |
| Test coverage | TBD | >80% | NOT STARTED |

## Recent Updates

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2024-03-21 | Fixed validator tool and updated test files with metadata |
| 2024-03-21 | Created TDD-BDD integration document |
| 2024-03-21 | Created documentation structure and initial documentation files |
| 2024-03-21 | Created TDD validator tool |
