# BDD Feature Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for refactoring our Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) features to improve maintainability, consistency, and traceability. The plan is organized into a series of releases, each building on the previous one to systematically improve our BDD testing framework.

## Current BDD Challenges

Based on analysis of our existing BDD structure, we have identified the following challenges:

1. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**: Feature files follow different naming patterns (e.g., "portal_functionality.feature" vs "generated_portal_functionality.feature").

2. **Tag Inconsistency**: Tags use different formats across feature files (e.g., `@REQ-1.1`, `@REQ-DSI-1.1`, `@BDD-1`).

3. **Duplicate and Overlapping Features**: Several features appear to be duplicated or overlap in content.

4. **Flat Feature Organization**: Features are organized in a flat structure, making navigation difficult.

5. **Requirements Traceability**: The relationship between requirements and scenarios is not always clear.

6. **Redundant Background Sections**: Similar Background sections are repeated across feature files.

7. **Varying Levels of Detail**: Scenarios vary in their level of detail and specification format.

8. **"Generated" Files**: Files with the "generated_" prefix suggest automated generation but their purpose isn't clear.

9. **System Improvement vs. Product Features**: Process improvement features are mixed with product features.

10. **Release Planning Integration**: Release plans exist but aren't clearly integrated with BDD execution.

## Agent System Integration

The BDD refactoring plan is closely integrated with our agent system:

1. **Agent Guidelines**: We have updated agent guidelines in `.cursor/rules/agent_guidelines.md` to emphasize BDD practices.

2. **BDD-Specific Agent Guidelines**: We've created `.cursor/rules/bdd_agent_guidelines.md` with detailed BDD guidance.

3. **Agent Helper Tool**: We'll implement `tools/agent_bdd_helper.py` to assist agents with BDD operations.

4. **Templates and Examples**: We'll provide templates and examples for agents to use when working with BDD.

This integration ensures that AI agents (like Claude in Cursor) can effectively operate our BDD system with consistent quality.

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Release 1 (BDD Analysis & Standardization)
2. Create the new tools needed for Release 1
3. Document the standards that will guide subsequent releases
4. Gain stakeholder approval for the refactoring plan
5. Implement subsequent releases according to the plan

## Responsible Team

TBD
