## Release-Specific Acceptance Criteria

## Release Verification Process

To verify that a release meets its acceptance criteria:

1. Run the release verification command:
   ```bash
   python tools/manage_releases.py --release <release_number> --action verify
   ```

2. Review the verification results and address any issues

3. Generate a release report:
   ```bash
   python tools/manage_releases.py --release <release_number> --action report
   ```

4. Update the PROJECT_STATUS.md document with the release completion

## Implementation Approach

We will use an agile approach to implement this plan:

1. **BDD-First Development**: Each release will start with BDD scenarios that define the expected behavior.

2. **Evolving Definition of Done**: Through this initiative, we may identify improvements to the general Definition of Done that would benefit all future work.

3. **Continuous Verification**: Each release will include verification steps to ensure it meets its acceptance criteria.

4. **Release Reports**: Each release will conclude with a report documenting accomplishments and next steps.

## Tools and Resources

We will leverage our existing tools and frameworks:

1. **BDD Framework**: We will use our existing BDD framework to define and verify requirements.

2. **Repository Tools**: We will extend our repository tools to support the improvement plan.

3. **Release Management**: We will use the new `manage_releases.py` tool to manage the release process.

4. **Documentation**: We will use our existing documentation structure to document the improvements.

## Potential DoD Evolution Contributions

This development system improvement initiative may identify opportunities to evolve the general Definition of Done. Potential areas for DoD evolution include:

1. **Repository Structure Standards**: Adding criteria related to repository structure consistency.

2. **Documentation Standards**: Enhancing documentation requirements to ensure clarity for both humans and agents.

3. **Automation Requirements**: Adding criteria related to automation and tooling to ensure maintainability.

4. **Agent Operability**: Adding criteria to ensure that code and documentation are optimized for agent navigation and modification.

Any proposed changes to the general DoD will follow the DoD Evolution Process defined in DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md:

1. Identify improvement opportunities during release retrospectives
2. Document proposed changes with rationale and expected benefits
3. Review and approve changes with the team and stakeholders
4. Update the DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md document
5. Communicate changes to all team members
6. Apply the updated DoD to all new work going forward

## Success Criteria

The development system improvement initiative will be considered successful when:

1. All releases meet their respective acceptance criteria.

2. The repository structure is clear and well-documented.

3. The agent system can effectively navigate and modify the codebase.

4. Redundancy is minimized throughout the codebase.

5. The development system can evolve without accumulating cruft.
