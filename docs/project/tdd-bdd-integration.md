Last Updated: 2024-03-21
Status: Draft
Owner: Development Team
Purpose: Define the integration between TDD and BDD approaches
Audience: Developers, QA Engineers
Lifecycle:
  - Created: To establish clear integration patterns between TDD and BDD

# TDD-BDD Integration

This document outlines how Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) work together in our development process.

## Table of Contents

2. [Testing Pyramid](#testing-pyramid)
3. [Workflows](#workflows)
4. [Traceability](#traceability)
5. [Lifecycle Coordination](#lifecycle-coordination)
6. [Best Practices](#best-practices)

## Overview

TDD and BDD are complementary approaches that serve different but related purposes in our development process:

- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Developer-focused approach for ensuring code correctness at the unit and component level.
- **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)**: Stakeholder-focused approach for ensuring application behavior meets business requirements.

When properly integrated, these approaches provide comprehensive test coverage from the unit level to end-to-end behavioral verification.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the testing pyramid model:

```
    /\
   /  \
  /BDD \      ← Behavior tests (few)
 /------\
/  TDD   \    ← Unit/Integration tests (many)
----------
```

- **Base (TDD)**: Many fine-grained unit and integration tests
  - Fast execution
  - High code coverage
  - Implementation-focused
  - Written in pytest

- **Top (BDD)**: Fewer broader behavior tests
  - Business-readable scenarios
  - Feature validation
  - End-user behavior focused
  - Written in Gherkin with behave

## Workflows

### TDD Workflow

1. Write a failing unit test for a small piece of functionality
2. Implement the code to make the test pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing
4. Repeat until component implementation is complete

### BDD Workflow

1. Define feature behavior using Gherkin scenarios
2. Implement step definitions
3. Run scenarios to verify behavior
4. Refine scenarios and implementation as needed

### Integrated Workflow

```
[Business Requirement]
        |
        v
[BDD Feature/Scenario Definition]
        |
        v
[TDD Red-Green-Refactor]
        |        |
        |        v
        |  [Unit Tests]
        |        |
        |        v
        |  [Implementation]
        |
        v
[BDD Scenario Execution]
        |
        v
[Feature Validation]
```

1. Start with a business requirement
2. Define BDD scenarios to validate the requirement
3. Use TDD to implement the components needed to fulfill the BDD scenarios
4. Execute BDD scenarios to verify the requirement is met

## Traceability

We maintain traceability between BDD features, TDD tests, and code:

### BDD to Requirements

Each BDD feature includes requirement tags:

```gherkin
@REQ-123 @REQ-124
Feature: User authentication
  ...
```

### TDD to BDD

Each unit test includes references to related BDD features:

```python
"""
Test Metadata:
- BDD Features: authentication.feature, user_management.feature
...
"""
```

### Code to Tests

Code includes references to tests:

```python
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    """
    Authenticate a user with username and password.
    
    Related Tests:
    - test_authentication.py:TestAuthenticator
    - test_user_management.py:test_user_authentication
    """
```

## Lifecycle Coordination

The lifecycle states of TDD and BDD artifacts are coordinated:

| BDD Status | TDD Status | Code Status |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Draft | Draft | In Development |
| Active | Active | Production |
| Deprecated | Deprecated | Deprecated |
| Archived | Archived | Removed/Archived |

### Lifecycle Transitions

When a BDD feature transitions to a new state, related TDD tests should follow:

1. **Feature Deprecation**: When a BDD feature is marked as deprecated, related TDD tests should be marked deprecated
2. **Feature Archival**: When a BDD feature is archived, related TDD tests should be archived

## Best Practices

### TDD Best Practices

1. **Maintain Traceability**: Reference related BDD features in test metadata
2. **Focus on Units**: Keep unit tests focused on small units of code
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate units for testing
4. **Follow Lifecycle**: Update test status when features change

### BDD Best Practices

1. **Business Language**: Write scenarios in business-readable language
2. **Focus on Behavior**: Test what the system does, not how it does it
3. **Proper Tagging**: Use tags for requirements, features, and test categories
4. **Follow Lifecycle**: Update feature status when requirements change

### Integration Best Practices

1. **Maintain Coverage**: Ensure both TDD and BDD test suites maintain high coverage
2. **Consistent Metadata**: Use consistent metadata formats across test types
3. **Coordinated Lifecycle**: Coordinate status changes between BDD and TDD artifacts
4. **Regular Validation**: Validate both test suites regularly

## Tools

The following tools support TDD-BDD integration:

1. **pytest**: Unit testing framework (TDD)
2. **behave**: BDD test runner
3. **tdd_validator.py**: Validates TDD metadata and implementation
4. **bdd_validator.py**: Validates BDD metadata and implementation
5. **coverage.py**: Tracks test coverage for both TDD and BDD tests
