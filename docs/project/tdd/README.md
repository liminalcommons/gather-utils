Title: TDD Documentation
Created: 2024-03-21
Last Updated: 2024-03-21
Status: Draft
Owner: Development Team
Purpose: Define the TDD approach and standards
Audience: Developers, QA Engineers
Lifecycle:
  - Created: To establish clear documentation for TDD practices
  - Active: Used to guide TDD development and maintenance
  - Obsolescence Conditions:
    1. When TDD approach is replaced by a different testing methodology
    2. When specific practices become obsolete due to tooling changes

# TDD Documentation

This directory contains documentation for our Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and practices.

Last Updated: 2024-03-21

## Documentation Components

1. **Lifecycle Management**
   - TDD artifact lifecycle states
   - Metadata standards
   - Maintenance processes
   - Archival procedures

2. **Best Practices**
   - TDD workflow
   - Test organization
   - Naming conventions
   - Coverage expectations
   - Mocking strategies
   - Testing patterns

3. **Templates**
   - Unit test templates
   - Test fixture templates
   - Metadata examples
   - Documentation templates

## Integration with BDD

TDD and BDD are complementary practices in our development workflow:

1. **TDD**: Used for unit-level testing focusing on implementation correctness
2. **BDD**: Used for feature-level testing focusing on behavior validation

See [TDD-BDD Integration](../../project/tdd-bdd-integration.md) for details on how these practices work together.

## Best Practices

1. **Test Creation**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Include proper metadata
   - Maintain atomic, focused tests

2. **Maintenance**
   - Regularly validate test relevance
   - Update metadata as needed
   - Archive obsolete tests
   - Maintain high coverage

3. **Documentation**
   - Document test purpose and approach
   - Include clear metadata
   - Document test dependencies
   - Maintain changelog

## Tools

The following tools support TDD practices:

1. **pytest**: Primary test runner
2. **repo_health_check.py**: Validates test metadata
3. **coverage.py**: Tracks test coverage
4. **tdd_validator.py**: Validates TDD implementation

## Contributing

When contributing:
1. Follow the established TDD workflow
2. Include required metadata
3. Use templates for consistency
4. Maintain test documentation
