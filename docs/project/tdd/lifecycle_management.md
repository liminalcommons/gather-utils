Created: 2024-03-21
Last Updated: 2024-03-21
Status: Draft
Owner: Development Team
Purpose: Define the lifecycle management of TDD tests and fixtures
Audience: Developers, QA Engineers
Lifecycle:
  - Created: To establish clear lifecycle management practices for TDD artifacts
  - Active: Used to guide TDD development and maintenance
  - Obsolescence Conditions:
    1. When TDD approach is replaced by a different testing methodology
    2. When specific practices become obsolete due to tooling changes

# TDD Lifecycle Management

This document outlines the lifecycle management practices for TDD tests and test fixtures.

## Table of Contents

1. [Test Lifecycle](#test-lifecycle)
2. [Test Fixture Lifecycle](#test-fixture-lifecycle)
3. [Validation and Maintenance](#validation-and-maintenance)
4. [Archival Process](#archival-process)
5. [TDD Tools Lifecycle](#tdd-tools-lifecycle)

## Test Lifecycle

### Test States

Tests in our TDD framework progress through the following states:

1. **Draft**: Initial creation, may be incomplete or failing
2. **Active**: Used in active testing, passing and validated
3. **Deprecated**: Testing functionality that is being phased out or replaced
4. **Archived**: Preserved for historical reference but no longer run

### State Transitions

```
     +--------+
     | Draft  |
     +--------+
         |

     +--------+
     | Active |<------+
     +--------+       |
         |            |
         v            |
  +-----------+       |
  | Deprecated|-------+
  +-----------+   (revived)
         |
         v
    +---------+
    | Archived |
    +---------+
```

### Required Metadata

All test files must include a metadata header containing:

```python
"""
Test Metadata:
- Created: YYYY-MM-DD
- Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
- Status: Draft|Active|Deprecated|Archived
- Owner: Team/Individual
- Purpose: Brief description of what this test is validating
- Lifecycle:
  - Created: Why this test was created
  - Active: Current usage status
  - Obsolescence Conditions:
    1. When this test would be considered obsolete
    2. Additional condition if applicable
- Last Validated: YYYY-MM-DD
"""
```

## Test Fixture Lifecycle

### Test Fixture States

Test fixtures follow the same lifecycle states as tests:

1. **Draft**: Initial implementation, may need refinement
2. **Active**: Used in active testing, fully implemented and validated
3. **Deprecated**: Fixtures for components being phased out
4. **Archived**: Preserved for reference but no longer used

### Required Metadata

All test fixture files must include metadata in their docstrings:

```python
"""
Test Fixture Metadata:
- Created: YYYY-MM-DD
- Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
- Status: Draft|Active|Deprecated|Archived
- Owner: Team/Individual
- Purpose: What these fixtures are used for
- Lifecycle:
  - Created: Why these fixtures were created
  - Active: Current usage status
  - Obsolescence Conditions:
    1. When these fixtures would be considered obsolete
    2. Additional condition if applicable
- Last Validated: YYYY-MM-DD

Changelog:
- YYYY-MM-DD | Author | Description of change
"""
```

## Validation and Maintenance

### Validation Process

1. **Quarterly Reviews**: Review all TDD tests and fixtures for continued relevance
2. **Validation Updates**: Update "Last Validated" date when confirming continued relevance
3. **Status Updates**: Change status when tests move through lifecycle stages

### Validation Tools

```bash
# Validate TDD test and fixture metadata
python tools/tdd_validator.py --validate-metadata

# Validate TDD test status (passing/failing)
python tools/tdd_validator.py --validate-status

# Generate lifecycle status report
python tools/tdd_validator.py --generate-lifecycle-report
```

### Maintenance Tasks

| Timeframe | Task |
|-----------|------|
| Weekly | Validate test status (CI/CD) |
| Monthly | Review and update test coverage |
| Quarterly | Full lifecycle review of all tests |

## Archival Process

When a test or fixture is no longer needed:

1. **Determination**: Identify tests/fixtures that are obsolete
2. **Documentation**: Update metadata with Deprecated status
3. **Communication**: Inform team of deprecated tests
4. **Grace Period**: Allow time for transition (typically 1-2 sprints)
5. **Archival**: Move to archive with Archived status
   
### Archive Location

```
tests/unit/archive/
├── test_files/          # Archived test files
└── fixtures/            # Archived test fixtures
```

## TDD Tools Lifecycle

### Tool Categories

TDD-specific tools in our repository include:

1. **Core TDD Tools**: Essential for everyday TDD work (pytest, coverage)
2. **Analysis Tools**: Used for analyzing TDD implementation
3. **Maintenance Tools**: Used for maintenance and refactoring
4. **One-Off Tools**: Used for specific, time-limited tasks

### Tool Lifecycle Management

1. **Creation**: Document purpose and expected lifecycle
2. **Validation**: Regular review for continued relevance
3. **Archival/Removal**: 
   - Archive tools with reference value
   - Remove tools that serve no future purpose

### Tool Metadata

All TDD tools must include metadata as specified in [TOOL_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md](../TOOL_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Validation**
   - Update "Last Validated" date quarterly
   - Review obsolescence conditions regularly
   - Proactively mark tests as Deprecated

2. **Clear Documentation**
   - Document reasons for status changes
   - Maintain changelog entries
   - Document dependencies between tests

3. **Test Coverage Maintenance**
   - Monitor coverage metrics
   - Ensure new code has appropriate tests
   - Refactor tests when implementation changes

## Integration with BDD

TDD and BDD tests serve different but complementary purposes:

1. **TDD Tests**: Focus on implementation correctness, unit-level behavior
2. **BDD Tests**: Focus on feature-level behavior and business requirements

The lifecycle management of both systems should be coordinated to ensure:
- Tests at both levels remain relevant
- Changes are reflected appropriately across test levels
- Obsolescence handling is consistent

See [TDD-BDD Integration](../tdd-bdd-integration.md) for more details.
