# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Overview

This document defines the structure for tracing requirements to BDD scenarios, test implementations, and verification status. It provides a standardized approach for ensuring requirements coverage and managing the relationships between requirements and their implementation in our BDD framework.

## Matrix Structure

The traceability matrix uses the following structure to map requirements to their implementation and verification:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Feature File | Scenario(s) | Step Definition File(s) | Test Status | Coverage |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|------------|----------|
| REQ-[domain]-[number] | Brief description | Path to feature file | List of scenario names | List of step definition files | Pass/Fail/Pending | Full/Partial/None |

## Example Matrix

Below is an example of how the traceability matrix should be populated:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Feature File | Scenario(s) | Step Definition File(s) | Test Status | Coverage |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|------------|----------|
| REQ-CLI-1 | The system shall list all maps in a Gather.town space | cli_command_execution.feature | List maps in a space | cli_command_execution_steps.py | Pass | Full |
| REQ-CLI-2 | The system shall explore portals in a specific map | cli_portal_exploration.feature | 1. Explore portals in a specific map<br>2. Display portal coordinates | cli_portal_exploration_steps.py | Partial (1 passing, 1 failing) | Partial |
| REQ-API-1 | The system shall authenticate with Gather.town API | api_client_authentication.feature | 1. Authenticate with valid credentials<br>2. Handle authentication errors | api_client_authentication_steps.py | Pass | Full |
| REQ-MODEL-1 | The Portal model shall validate coordinates | model_portal_validation.feature | 1. Validate portal coordinates<br>2. Detect invalid coordinates | model_portal_validation_steps.py<br>model_validation_common_steps.py | Pass | Full |

## Domain Categories

Requirements are organized by domain categories, each with its own prefix:

- **CLI**: Command Line Interface requirements
- **API**: API functionality requirements
- **MODEL**: Data model requirements
- **CORE**: Core functionality requirements
- **PROCESS**: Process improvement requirements
- **BDD**: BDD testing framework requirements

## Coverage Definitions

Coverage levels indicate how completely a requirement is addressed by BDD scenarios:

- **Full**: All aspects of the requirement are covered by passing scenarios
- **Partial**: Some aspects of the requirement are covered, or some scenarios are failing
- **None**: No scenarios exist for this requirement, or all scenarios are failing

## Test Status Definitions

Test status indicates the verification state of the scenarios:

- **Pass**: All scenarios pass for this requirement
- **Partial**: Some scenarios pass, some fail
- **Fail**: All scenarios fail for this requirement
- **Pending**: Scenarios exist but are not yet implemented
- **Missing**: No scenarios exist for this requirement

## Maintenance Guidelines

The traceability matrix should be:

1. **Generated Automatically**: When possible, use automated tools to generate the matrix from BDD feature files
2. **Updated Regularly**: Updated after changes to requirements or BDD scenarios
3. **Version Controlled**: Committed to the repository with each release
4. **Reviewed**: Reviewed as part of the release process to ensure full coverage
5. **Referenced**: Used during planning to identify coverage gaps

## Gap Analysis Process

Use the traceability matrix to perform regular gap analysis:

1. Identify requirements with "None" or "Partial" coverage
2. Prioritize gaps based on requirement importance
3. Create BDD scenarios to address gaps
4. Update the matrix after implementing new scenarios

## Integration with CI/CD

The traceability matrix should be:

1. Generated as part of the CI/CD pipeline
2. Published as a report with test results
3. Used as a quality gate in the release process
4. Included in release documentation

## Implementation Plan

To implement the traceability matrix:

1. **Initial Setup**: Create a manual baseline matrix for existing requirements
2. **Tool Development**: Develop/adapt tools to generate the matrix automatically
3. **Process Integration**: Incorporate matrix updates into the development workflow
4. **Regular Review**: Schedule regular reviews of the matrix to identify gaps
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Refine the matrix format and process based on feedback

## Tool Support

The following tools will support the traceability matrix:

1. **bdd_traceability_matrix.py**: Generates the matrix from BDD features
2. **bdd_coverage_report.py**: Provides coverage statistics for requirements
3. **bdd_gap_analysis.py**: Identifies coverage gaps for planning

By maintaining this traceability matrix, we ensure that:
- All requirements are covered by BDD scenarios
- The relationship between requirements and tests is clear
- Coverage gaps are identified and addressed
- Quality and completeness can be measured and reported
