# User Stories and Feature Mapping

This document outlines the key user stories and features of the Gather Manager tool from a user-centric perspective.

## User Personas

### Space Administrator
A person who manages a Gather.town space and needs to understand and maintain the portal structure.

### Space Designer
A person who designs and builds Gather.town spaces and needs to create and modify portals.

### Developer
A person who is building tools or integrations with Gather.town and needs to understand the API.

## User Stories

### Discovering Portal Structure

**As a Space Administrator**  
**I want to** see all the portals in my Gather.town space  
**So that** I can understand how my space is connected

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- List all maps in the space
- Show all portals in each map
- Display portal connections between maps
- Visualize the portal network

### Analyzing Portal Properties

**As a Space Designer**  
**I want to** analyze the properties of portals in my space  
**So that** I can understand how they are configured and ensure consistency

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Show common properties across portals
- Identify unusual or inconsistent portal configurations
- Provide statistics on portal usage and types
- Flag potential issues with portal configurations

### Troubleshooting Portal Issues

**As a Space Administrator**  
**I want to** identify and fix issues with portals  
**So that** users can navigate my space without problems

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detect broken portal connections
- Identify one-way portals
- Flag portals with missing target information
- Suggest fixes for common portal issues

### Exploring API Capabilities

**As a Developer**  
**I want to** explore the Gather.town API capabilities related to portals  
**So that** I can build integrations or tools

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Demonstrate API calls for retrieving portal information
- Show how to modify portals through the API
- Provide examples of common portal operations
- Document API limitations and workarounds

### Debugging Map Objects

**As a Space Designer**  
**I want to** analyze all objects in a map  
**So that** I can understand what objects exist and how they're configured

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- List all object types in a map
- Show distribution of object types
- Identify potential portal objects
- Analyze common properties of objects
