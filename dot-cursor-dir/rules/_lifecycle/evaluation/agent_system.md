```

## Meta-Systemic Principle Application

### Parsimony
- Reference canonical knowledge sources rather than duplicating
- Link to detailed analysis rather than reproducing all data
- Focus on unique insights not captured elsewhere
- Maintain single source of truth for agent capabilities

Example:
```markdown
For detailed capability metrics, see the [Agent Capability Dashboard](mdc:../metrics/agent-capability.md) which contains comprehensive data for all capability domains.

This evaluation references the standard capability areas defined in our [Agent Capability Framework](mdc:../agent/capability-framework.md) without duplicating the definitions.
```

### Tensegrity
- Evaluate how agent capabilities support each other
- Assess balance of responsibilities between human and AI
- Document knowledge flow between team members
- Identify opportunities to strengthen collaborative relationships

Example:
```markdown
## Human-AI Responsibility Balance

| Responsibility Area | Human Role | Agent Role | Balance Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| Strategic Direction | Primary | Supporting | ✅ Well-balanced |
| Implementation Patterns | Supporting | Primary | ✅ Well-balanced |
| Quality Assurance | Shared | Shared | ✅ Well-balanced |
| Documentation | Supporting | Primary | ✅ Well-balanced |
| Problem Solving | Primary | Supporting | ⚠️ Needs adjustment |

The current responsibility distribution has evolved to a generally effective balance, with clear complementary strengths. The problem-solving area could benefit from more balanced contribution, with enhanced agent capability for novel problem recognition.
```

### Modularity
- Assess capability boundary effectiveness
- Evaluate knowledge domain separation
- Measure interaction pattern modularity
- Review independence of capability evolution

Example:
```markdown
## Agent Capability Modularity

The pattern recognition capability demonstrates effective modularity:

- **Clear Capability Boundary**: Well-defined scope and function
- **Independent Evolution**: Enhancement without affecting other capabilities
- **Clean Interfaces**: Clear inputs and outputs with other capabilities
- **Internal Cohesion**: Tightly related functionality grouped together
- **External Decoupling**: Limited dependencies on other capabilities

This modularity enabled targeted enhancement of the pattern recognition capability without requiring changes to other areas.
```

### Coherence
- Evaluate pattern consistency across agent capabilities
- Assess terminology consistency across knowledge domains
- Measure consistency of approach in similar interactions
- Identify areas where coherence could be improved

Example:
```markdown
## Agent Response Coherence

| Response Type | Coherence Rating | Observations |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Implementation Guidance | ✅ High | Consistent pattern application and style |
| Architecture Guidance | ✅ High | Consistent architectural principles |
| Problem-Solving Approach | ⚠️ Moderate | Some variation in structure and method |
| Documentation Guidance | ✅ High | Highly consistent structure and depth |

**Learning**: Guidance that follows explicit templates and patterns shows higher coherence than more open-ended interactions. Future improvements should focus on standardizing problem-solving approaches.
```

### Clarity
- Assess explanation clarity and comprehensiveness
- Evaluate example quality and relevance
- Measure effectiveness of concept communication
- Identify areas where clarity could be improved

Example:
```markdown
## Agent Explanation Clarity

The enhanced pattern explanation approach with structured elements (**Pattern Name**, **Problem Solved**, **Implementation Guide**, and **Example**) significantly improved understanding and application.

**Evidence**: 
- 35% reduction in clarification questions
- 40% faster pattern implementation by humans
- 30% higher correct application rate
- Positive feedback from team members on clarity

**Learning**: Structured explanations with concrete examples are substantially more effective than conceptual descriptions. All explanation templates should include specific examples and clear structural elements.
```

### Adaptivity
- Evaluate how well agent adapts to different contexts
- Assess flexibility in handling various situations
- Measure appropriate application of context-specific knowledge
- Identify opportunities to improve adaptivity

Example:
```markdown
## Context Adaptation Effectiveness

| Context Dimension | Adaptation Quality | Key Observations |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| System Type (Code/Release/Agent) | ✅ High | Excellent adaptation to different system contexts |
| Release Scope (Major/Minor/Patch) | ✅ High | Appropriate rigor based on release scope |
| Technical Domain | ⚠️ Moderate | Strong in familiar domains, weaker in specialized areas |
| Team Structure | ⚠️ Moderate | Good for small teams, needs improvement for larger teams |

**Learning**: The context detection framework effectively guides adaptation along well-defined dimensions. Less structured dimensions like specialized technical domains show more variation in adaptation quality.
```
