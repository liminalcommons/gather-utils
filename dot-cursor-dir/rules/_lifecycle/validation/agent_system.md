# Agent System Validation Guidance

<critical>
This rule provides specialized guidance for validating agent system enhancements. Apply these validation approaches to ensure agent capabilities meet requirements, maintain knowledge integrity, and effectively embody meta-systemic principles.
</critical>

## Agent Validation Context

Agent system validation focuses on five key dimensions:

1. **Capability Validation**: Verifying that agent capabilities meet functional requirements
2. **Knowledge Validation**: Ensuring knowledge domains are accurate, complete, and well-structured
3. **Interaction Validation**: Validating interaction patterns and collaboration effectiveness
4. **Meta-Systemic Validation**: Assessing principle application across agent systems
5. **Integration Validation**: Verifying agent integration across system contexts

## Validation Approach

Structure your agent validation approach as follows:

### 1. Capability Validation

Verify agent capabilities against requirements:

```markdown
## Capability Validation

### Capability Testing Matrix
| Capability | Test Scenario | Expected Result | Validation Method | Status |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Pattern recognition | Complex code analysis | Identify design patterns, anti-patterns | Example-based comparison | ✅/❌ |
| Code generation | Create implementation from requirements | Functionally correct, follows principles | Code review, test execution | ✅/❌ |
| Documentation | Generate artifact from template | Complete, clear, accurate documentation | Document review | ✅/❌ |

### Scenario-Based Validation
- Create realistic scenarios that validate each capability
- Include both common and edge cases
- Verify capability boundaries and failure handling
- Test cross-capability integration

### Validation Techniques

#### Comparative Validation

- Compare with previous versions for regression testing
- Assess capabilities across different contexts
- Document quantitative metrics for each capability
```

### 2. Knowledge Validation

## Meta-Systemic Principle Application

### Parsimony
- Reference existing knowledge rather than duplicating
- Maintain canonical validation techniques
- Create reusable validation scenarios
- Establish consistent validation metrics

Example:
```markdown
### Knowledge Validation Approach

This validation follows our [standard knowledge validation framework](mdc:../validation/knowledge-validation-framework.md) with specific adaptations for agent knowledge domains.

Validation metrics are consistent with our [established capability metrics](mdc:../metrics/capability-metrics.md) to enable comparison across releases.
```

### Tensegrity
- Balance validation across all capability dimensions
- Ensure validation techniques support each other
- Connect validation findings to improvement actions
- Link agent validation to other system contexts

Example:
```markdown
### Balanced Validation Approach

This validation plan balances different validation dimensions:

| Dimension | Validation Techniques | Connection to Other Dimensions |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Capability | Example-based testing, benchmark assessment | Feeds into knowledge and interaction validation |
| Knowledge | Domain assessment, application validation | Supports capability and integration validation |
| Interaction | Pattern assessment, simulation | Connects to capability and integration validation |
| Meta-Systemic | Principle-specific validation | Connects all dimensions through principle lens |
| Integration | Cross-system assessment | Links agent validation to broader system contexts |
```

### Modularity
- Organize validation by distinct dimensions
- Create clear boundaries between validation approaches
- Define explicit validation interfaces
- Design validation for independent execution

Example:
```markdown
### Modular Validation Structure

This validation plan is organized into independent modules that can be executed separately:

1. **Capability Validation Module**: Focused on functional requirements
2. **Knowledge Validation Module**: Focused on knowledge quality
3. **Interaction Validation Module**: Focused on collaboration effectiveness
4. **Meta-Systemic Validation Module**: Focused on principle application
5. **Integration Validation Module**: Focused on cross-context integration

Each module has clear inputs, processes, and outputs, allowing for independent execution while maintaining overall validation integrity.
```

### Coherence
- Apply consistent validation approaches
- Use standard validation terminology
- Maintain pattern consistency across validation
- Align with broader validation frameworks

Example:
```markdown
### Coherent Validation Approach

This validation follows consistent patterns across all dimensions:

1. **Assessment Matrix**: Used for structured evaluation across all dimensions
2. **Scenario-Based Validation**: Applied consistently for capabilities and interactions
3. **Evidence Documentation**: Follows standard template across all areas
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: Uses consistent measurement approaches throughout

This approach aligns with our broader validation framework while adapting to agent-specific needs.
```

### Clarity
- Provide explicit validation criteria
- Include concrete examples of validation approaches
- Use clear, specific language in findings
- Document validation rationale

Example:
```markdown
### Clarity in Validation Criteria

Each validation criterion is explicitly defined with examples:

**Capability Effectiveness Example**:

*High Effectiveness*: Agent consistently applies appropriate architecture patterns across different codebases, correctly identifying patterns and anti-patterns in >90% of cases, and providing contextually appropriate implementation guidance.

*Medium Effectiveness*: Agent applies appropriate patterns in most cases (70-90%), with occasional misidentification or suboptimal implementation guidance.

*Low Effectiveness*: Agent frequently misidentifies patterns (<70% accuracy) or provides inappropriate implementation guidance.
```

### Adaptivity
- Scale validation depth to release complexity
- Adapt validation techniques to capability type
- Adjust validation criteria based on context
- Vary validation intensity based on risk

Example:
```markdown
### Adaptive Validation Approach

This validation plan adapts based on several factors:

1. **Capability Criticality**: Critical capabilities receive more intensive validation
2. **Change Magnitude**: Major changes receive deeper validation
3. **Release Scope**: Validation depth scales with release scope
4. **Usage Context**: Validation scenarios adapt to different usage contexts

The validation intensity matrix guides this adaptation:

| Factor | Low | Medium | High |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| Criticality | Basic validation | Standard validation | Comprehensive validation |
| Change Magnitude | Focused testing | Feature testing | Comprehensive testing |
| Release Scope | Issue verification | Feature validation | System validation |
```
