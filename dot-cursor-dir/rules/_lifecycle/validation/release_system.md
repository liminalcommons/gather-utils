# Release System Validation Guidance

<critical>
This rule provides specialized guidance for the validation phase when the primary system context is release process evolution. Apply these guidelines in conjunction with the core validation phase rules to ensure thorough validation of process changes.
</critical>

## Release System Validation Approach

When validating release process changes:

### 1. Process Integrity Validation

Verify that the modified release process maintains integrity:

```markdown
## Process Integrity Validation
