# Process Patterns

<critical>
Apply these process patterns when designing, implementing, or evolving release processes to ensure consistent application of meta-systemic principles across the entire release lifecycle.
</critical>

## Pattern Application Process

When working with release processes, follow this process:

1. **IDENTIFY** the process type and context
2. **SELECT** the appropriate patterns for that context
3. **APPLY** the patterns consistently across the process
4. **VALIDATE** that the process effectively embodies meta-systemic principles

## Core Process Patterns

### Process Structure Pattern

```yaml
pattern:
  name: "Lifecycle Phase Structure"
  principles: [modularity, coherence]
  context: "Release process design"
  application:
    - "Organize processes into clear, distinct phases"
    - "Define explicit entry and exit criteria for each phase"
    - "Create clear handoffs between phases"
    - "Ensure each phase has a specific purpose and responsibility"
  example: |
    # Release Lifecycle Process
    
    ## Inception Phase
    
    **Purpose**: Define release scope, objectives, and context.
    
    **Entry Criteria**:
    - Business need identified
    - Initial stakeholders identified
    - Resource availability confirmed
    
    **Key Activities**:
    - Define release objectives
    - Establish scope boundaries
    - Assess context for principle application
    - Identify stakeholders and dependencies
    
    **Exit Criteria**:
    - Release definition document approved
    - Stakeholder alignment confirmed
    - Context assessment completed
    
    **Outputs**:
    - Release definition document
    - Context assessment
    - Stakeholder matrix
    
    **Handoff To**: Planning Phase
    
    ## Planning Phase
    
    **Purpose**: Create detailed implementation plan.
    
    **Entry Criteria**:
    - Completed release definition document
    - Stakeholder alignment confirmed
    - Resource allocation confirmed
    
    [Additional phases follow similar structure...]
```

### Process Integration Pattern

```yaml
pattern:
  name: "Process Component Integration"
  principles: [tensegrity, coherence]
  context: "Integrating process components"
  application:
    - "Define clear interfaces between process components"
    - "Ensure bidirectional value exchange between components"
    - "Create explicit handoff procedures"
    - "Maintain consistent interaction patterns"
  example: |
    # Integration Between Planning and Development Phases
    
    ## Interface Definition
    
    **From Planning to Development**:
    - Release plan document with task breakdown
    - Dependency map with critical path identified
    - Resource allocation matrix
    - Risk assessment and mitigation plans
    
    **From Development to Planning**:
    - Feasibility feedback on planned tasks
    - Estimation accuracy information
    - Task dependency validation
    - Risk assessment refinement
    
    ## Handoff Procedure
    
    ### Planning-to-Development Handoff
    
    1. Planning team completes release plan
    2. Planning team conducts handoff meeting with development team
    3. Development team reviews plan and provides initial feedback
    4. Planning team addresses critical concerns
    5. Development team formally accepts handoff
    6. Planning team remains available for clarification
    
    ### Development-to-Planning Feedback Loop
    
    1. Development team provides weekly plan execution status
    2. Planning team updates plans based on actual progress
    3. Development team highlights estimation variances
    4. Planning team refines estimation approach for future plans
    
    ## Interaction Patterns
    
    **Regular Synchronization**:
    - Daily status updates
    - Weekly plan refinement
    - Bi-weekly retrospective
    
    **Exception Handling**:
    - Blocker identification process
    - Escalation path for dependency issues
    - Plan adjustment protocol
```

### Process Adaptation Pattern

```yaml
pattern:
  name: "Context-Sensitive Process Adaptation"
  principles: [adaptivity, clarity]
  context: "Adapting processes to different contexts"
  application:
    - "Define core process requirements versus adaptable elements"
    - "Create explicit adaptation guidelines for different contexts"
    - "Document adaptation rationale when adjusting processes"
    - "Maintain core intent while allowing appropriate variation"
  example: |
    # Release Process Adaptation Framework
    
    ## Core Requirements (All Contexts)
    
    These elements must be preserved in all process adaptations:
    
    - Clear separation between lifecycle phases
    - Explicit documentation of requirements
    - Quality validation before deployment
    - Post-release evaluation
    
    ## Adaptable Elements
    
    These elements may be adapted based on context:
    
    - Level of documentation detail
    - Review process formality
    - Validation rigor
    - Planning granularity
    
    ## Context-Specific Adaptations
    
    ### Major Release Adaptation
    
    - **Documentation**: Comprehensive with detailed sections
    - **Reviews**: Formal reviews with stakeholder signoff
    - **Validation**: Comprehensive testing across all areas
    - **Planning**: Detailed breakdown with explicit dependencies
    
    ### Minor Release Adaptation
    
    - **Documentation**: Standard level of detail
    - **Reviews**: Standard review process
    - **Validation**: Focus on affected components with regression testing
    - **Planning**: Standard task breakdown
    
    ### Patch Release Adaptation
    
    - **Documentation**: Focused on changed components
    - **Reviews**: Streamlined review process
    - **Validation**: Targeted testing on affected areas
    - **Planning**: Simplified planning with focus on implementation
    
    ### Emergency Release Adaptation
    
    - **Documentation**: Minimal, focused on critical information
    - **Reviews**: Expedited review process
    - **Validation**: Critical path testing only
    - **Planning**: Lightweight planning focused on immediate needs
    
    ## Adaptation Procedure
    
    1. Identify release context (major, minor, patch, emergency)
    2. Reference appropriate adaptation template
    3. Document any additional adaptations with rationale
    4. Validate adaptations preserve core requirements
    5. Communicate adaptations to team members
```

        # Task Breakdown Pattern
        
        ## Task Hierarchy Structure
        
        Organize tasks in a hierarchical structure:
        
        1. **Major Component/Feature**: High-level grouping
           - **Subcomponent/Task 1.1**: Specific implementable task

        ## Dependency Types
        
        Identify and document these dependency types:
        
        - **Hard Dependencies**: Must be completed before task can begin
        - **Soft Dependencies**: Should be completed first but can overlap
        - **External Dependencies**: Reliance on factors outside the team
        - **Bidirectional Dependencies**: Tasks that affect each other
        
        ## Dependency Documentation Structure
        
        Document dependencies in multiple formats:
        
        ### Dependency Matrix
        
        | Task | Depends On | Required For |
        |------|------------|--------------|
        | Task A | Task X, Task Y | Task B, Task C |
        | Task B | Task A | Task D |
        | Task C | Task A | Task E |
        
        ### Critical Path Identification
        
        Highlight the critical path through dependencies:
        
        Task X → Task Y → Task A → Task B → Task D
        
        ### Dependency Graph Visualization
        
        [Include visual representation of dependency network]

        # Pattern Application Pattern
        
        ## Pattern Identification Process
        
        Follow this process for applying patterns:
        
        1. **Identify Context**: Determine the specific context for implementation
        2. **Select Patterns**: Choose appropriate patterns from the pattern library
        3. **Adapt Patterns**: Tailor patterns to the specific implementation context
        4. **Document Adaptations**: Record pattern adaptations with rationale
        
        ## Pattern Documentation Structure
        
        Document pattern application using:
        
        - **Pattern Reference**: Link to canonical pattern definition
        - **Context Description**: Specific implementation context
        - **Adaptation Details**: How the pattern was adapted
        - **Rationale**: Why adaptations were made
        
        ## Example Pattern Application
        
        ### Repository Pattern Application
        
        **Pattern Reference**: [Repository Pattern](mdc:../patterns/repository-pattern.md)
        
        **Context Description**: Implementation for search index access with vector database backend
        
        **Adaptation Details**:
        - Extended standard repository with vector search methods
        - Added embedding management within repository
        - Implemented caching layer for frequently accessed vectors
        - Created batch operation support for performance
        
        **Rationale**:
        - Vector operations require specialized methods beyond standard repository
        - Embedding management naturally pairs with repository operations
        - Performance requirements necessitate caching and batch operations
        
        ### Code Implementation
        
        ```typescript
        // Implementation of adapted repository pattern
        class SearchIndexRepository implements Repository<SearchDocument> {
          constructor(
            private vectorDb: VectorDatabase,
            private embeddingService: EmbeddingService,
            private cache: SearchCache
          ) {}
          
          // Standard repository methods
          async findById(id: string): Promise<SearchDocument | null> {
            // Implementation
          }
          
          async save(document: SearchDocument): Promise<void> {
            // Implementation
          }
          
          // Vector-specific adaptations
          async findSimilar(embedding: Vector, limit: number): Promise<SearchDocument[]> {
            // Vector similarity search implementation
          }
          
          async batchIndex(documents: SearchDocument[]): Promise<void> {
            // Batch indexing implementation
          }
        }
        ```
```

           - Verify deployment without activating features
           - Prepare monitoring dashboards
        
        2. **Initial Activation Phase**
           - Enable search foundation for 10% of users
           - Monitor performance and error rates
           - If stable, continue; if issues, rollback
        
        3. **Expanded Activation Phase**
           - Increase to 25% of users
           - Enable natural language features for 10% of users
           - Monitor all metrics
           - If stable, continue; if issues, adjust or rollback
        
        4. **Full Deployment Phase**
           - Gradually increase to 100% of users
           - Enable all features for all users
           - Monitor system under full load
        
        **Verification Steps**:
        
        - **Pre-Activation Verification**:
          - Deployment completed without errors
          - Services operational
          - Monitoring operational
        
        - **Activation Verification**:

          - Performance meets targets
          - Error rates within acceptable range
          - User feedback positive
        
        **Rollback Procedures**:
        
        - **Feature-Level Rollback**:
          - Disable specific problematic features
          - Monitor system stabilization
          - Troubleshoot issues while maintaining service
        
        - **Full Rollback**:
          - Disable all new features
          - If needed, revert to previous code version
          - Follow standard rollback runbook
        
        **Communication Plan**:
        
        - **Pre-Deployment**:
          - Notify all stakeholders 48 hours in advance
          - Send reminder 2 hours before deployment
        
        - **During Deployment**:
          - Status updates at each phase completion
          - Immediate notification of any issues
        
        - **Post-Deployment**:
          - Success notification with feature availability

## Meta-Systemic Application to Processes

### Parsimony in Processes

When applying parsimony to processes:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Define each process element once and reference elsewhere
2. **Template Reuse**: Create reusable templates for common process patterns
3. **Common Activity Definitions**: Define activities once and reference in multiple processes
4. **Reference Over Duplication**: Link to canonical documentation rather than duplicating

Example:
```markdown
## Parsimony in Release Process

Instead of defining review procedures separately for each artifact, create a canonical review process and reference it:

### Standard Review Process
[Define comprehensive review process here]

### Release Definition Review
Follows the [Standard Review Process](mdc:#standard-review-process) with these specific adaptations:
- Additional focus on objective clarity
- Specific stakeholder involvement requirements
- Enhanced scope validation

### Release Plan Review
Follows the [Standard Review Process](mdc:#standard-review-process) with these specific adaptations:
- Additional focus on dependency validation
- Enhanced resource allocation review
- Task breakdown completeness assessment
```

### Tensegrity in Processes

When applying tensegrity to processes:

1. **Balanced Responsibilities**: Distribute responsibilities appropriately between roles
2. **Bidirectional Handoffs**: Create clear, bidirectional handoffs between phases
3. **Mutual Support**: Design process components to support each other
4. **Resilient Connections**: Create flexible connections between process elements

Example:
```markdown
## Tensegrity in Release Process

The release process demonstrates tensegrity through balanced handoffs:

### Planning to Development Handoff
**Planning Team Provides**:
- Comprehensive release plan
- Dependency mapping
- Risk assessment
- Resource allocation

**Development Team Provides**:
- Implementation feasibility feedback
- Technical constraint identification
- Estimation refinement
- Alternative approach suggestions

This bidirectional exchange ensures both teams provide value to each other, creating a resilient connection point.
```

### Modularity in Processes

When applying modularity to processes:

1. **Clear Phase Boundaries**: Define explicit boundaries between process phases
2. **Well-Defined Interfaces**: Create clear interfaces for phase handoffs
3. **Encapsulated Activities**: Keep phase-specific activities within phase boundaries
4. **Independent Evolution**: Allow phases to evolve independently

Example:
```markdown
## Modularity in Release Process

The release process demonstrates modularity through clear phase boundaries:

### Validation Phase Boundary

**Entry Criteria (Interface IN)**:
- Complete implementation delivered
- Development verification completed
- Test environment prepared
- Test data available

**Exit Criteria (Interface OUT)**:
- All validation criteria met
- Issues documented and prioritized
- Validation report completed
- Deployment readiness confirmed

**Encapsulated Activities**:
- Test execution
- Performance validation
- Security assessment
- Documentation review

This clear boundary allows the validation phase to evolve independently while maintaining clear interfaces with adjacent phases.
```

### Coherence in Processes

When applying coherence to processes:

1. **Consistent Structure**: Use consistent structure across similar processes
2. **Standard Terminology**: Maintain consistent terminology across all processes
3. **Pattern Consistency**: Apply the same patterns for similar process elements
4. **Visual Consistency**: Use consistent visual representations

Example:
```markdown
## Coherence in Release Process

The release process maintains coherence through consistent phase structure:

### Standard Phase Structure
All phases follow this consistent structure:
- **Purpose**: Clear statement of phase objective
- **Entry Criteria**: Required inputs to begin the phase
- **Key Activities**: Core activities within the phase
- **Roles**: Responsibilities within the phase
- **Artifacts**: Documents and deliverables
- **Exit Criteria**: Requirements to complete the phase
- **Handoff**: Transition to the next phase

This consistent structure creates a coherent process that is easy to understand and follow.
```

### Clarity in Processes

When applying clarity to processes:

1. **Clear Instructions**: Provide explicit, unambiguous instructions
2. **Concrete Examples**: Include examples for complex activities
3. **Visual Aids**: Use diagrams, flowcharts, and other visual elements
4. **Explicit Rationale**: Explain the reasoning behind process elements

Example:
```markdown
## Clarity in Release Process

The release process demonstrates clarity through explicit instructions with examples:

### Task Breakdown Activity

**Instructions**:
Decompose each feature into specific, implementable tasks following these guidelines:
1. Each task should be completable within 1-3 days
2. Tasks should have clear, testable completion criteria
3. Dependencies between tasks should be explicitly identified
4. Technical approach should be briefly described

**Example**:
```markdown
### 1.2 Document Embedding Generation
- **Description**: Create the document embedding pipeline
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - All document types correctly processed
  - Embeddings accurately represent document content
  - Batch processing completes within performance constraints
  - Real-time generation meets latency requirements
- **Dependencies**: 1.1 Vector Database Implementation
- **Effort Estimate**: 4 days
- **Technical Approach**: Use transformer model with caching layer
```

This explicit example makes the expectations clear and unambiguous.
```

### Adaptivity in Processes

When applying adaptivity to processes:

1. **Context-Sensitive Variations**: Create appropriate process variations for different contexts
2. **Scaling Mechanisms**: Provide mechanisms to scale process intensity
3. **Explicit Adaptation Guidance**: Document when and how to adapt processes
4. **Core Requirements vs. Adaptable Elements**: Distinguish between fixed and flexible elements

Example:
```markdown
## Adaptivity in Release Process

The release process demonstrates adaptivity through context-sensitive variations:

### Release Classification Adaptations

The release process adapts based on release classification:

**Major Release Process**:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Formal reviews with stakeholder signoff
- Extensive validation across all areas
- Phased deployment with formal gates

**Minor Release Process**:
- Standard documentation
- Standard review process
- Focused validation on affected areas
- Controlled deployment with monitoring

**Patch Release Process**:
- Minimal documentation focused on changes
- Streamlined review process
- Targeted validation of specific changes
- Efficient deployment with rollback plan

**Emergency Release Process**:
- Critical information only
- Expedited review process
- Validation focused on fix verification
- Rapid deployment with enhanced monitoring

These adaptations preserve the core process structure while adjusting the intensity and formality based on context.
