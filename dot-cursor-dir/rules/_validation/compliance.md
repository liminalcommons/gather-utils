# Meta-Systemic Compliance Framework

<critical>
This framework enables comprehensive assessment of compliance with meta-systemic principles across all system aspects. Use it to verify principle application, identify improvement opportunities, and ensure balanced principle application appropriate to the system context.
</critical>

## Compliance Assessment Purpose

Meta-systemic compliance assessment serves to:

1. **Verify Principle Application**: Ensure all meta-systemic principles are appropriately applied
2. **Identify Balance Issues**: Detect improper emphasis or neglect of specific principles
3. **Validate Context Appropriateness**: Confirm principle application is adapted to specific contexts
4. **Discover Improvement Opportunities**: Identify areas for enhanced principle application
5. **Track Principle Evolution**: Monitor how principle application evolves over time
6. **Ensure System Integrity**: Verify that the overall system maintains coherent principle application

## Comprehensive Assessment Approach

### System-Wide Assessment Matrix

Use this matrix to assess principle application across all system areas:

```markdown
## System-Wide Principle Assessment

| System Area | Parsimony | Tensegrity | Modularity | Coherence | Clarity | Adaptivity | Overall |
|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| Area 1 | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score |
| Area 2 | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score |
| Area 3 | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score |
| Overall | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score | Score |

### Scoring Legend
- **5**: Exemplary application, could serve as a model for others
- **4**: Strong application with minor improvement opportunities
- **3**: Adequate application with some notable gaps
- **2**: Weak application with significant issues
- **1**: Poor application with critical deficiencies
- **N/A**: Not applicable to this area

### Context Appropriateness
- **System Context**: [Code|Release|Agent]
- **System Maturity**: [Early Exploration|Active Development|Maintenance|Legacy]
- **Team Structure**: [Solo Developer|Small Team|Multiple Teams|Distributed]
- **Expected Principle Emphasis**: [Primary principles for this context]
```
