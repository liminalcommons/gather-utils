# Evolution Validation Process

<critical>
Apply this validation process to ensure that system evolution maintains integrity while adapting to changing requirements. This process verifies that changes respect meta-systemic principles while enabling appropriate evolution.
</critical>

## Core Evolution Framework

This framework provides a systematic approach to validating system evolution. Use this process when evaluating changes, migrations, or architectural transitions.

### Evolution Validation Process

1. **Capture Current State**: Document the existing system state before changes
2. **Analyze Change Impact**: Evaluate the impact of proposed changes on the system
3. **Validate Evolution Path**: Ensure changes follow a coherent evolution path
4. **Verify Principle Preservation**: Confirm that changes maintain meta-systemic principles
