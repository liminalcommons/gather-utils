Feature: Testing & Quality Assurance
  As a developer
  I want comprehensive test coverage and high code quality
  So that the Portal Explorer is reliable and maintainable

  Background:
    Given I have the Portal Explorer codebase
    And I have set up the testing framework

  @REQ-4.1
  Scenario: Create Model Tests
    Given I have data models for the Portal Explorer
    When I implement tests for all data models
    Then the tests should verify model validation
    And the tests should cover portal object validation
    And the test coverage for models should be at least 90%

  @REQ-4.2
  Scenario: Enhance API Client Tests
    Given I have the GatherClient implementation
    When I add tests for portal functionality
    Then the tests should use mock API responses
    And the tests should verify correct portal extraction
    And the test coverage for the API client should be at least 90%

  @REQ-4.3
  Scenario: Create Explorer Service Tests
    Given I have the PortalExplorer service
    When I implement tests for the service
    Then the tests should verify portal analysis functionality
    And the tests should cover connection analysis
    And the test coverage for the service should be at least 90%

  @REQ-4.4
  Scenario: Implement CLI Tests
    Given I have the CLI implementation
    When I add tests for CLI commands
    Then the tests should verify command functionality
    And the tests should cover error handling
    And the test coverage for the CLI should be at least 90%

  @REQ-4.5
  Scenario: Create Integration Tests
    Given I have all components of the Portal Explorer
    When I implement integration tests
    Then the tests should verify the full workflow
    And the tests should use both mock data and real data
    And the integration tests should cover all main use cases

  @REQ-4.6
  Scenario: BDD Test Integration
    Given I have BDD scenarios for all features
    When I implement step definitions for all scenarios
    Then all BDD tests should pass
    And the BDD tests should cover all requirements
    And the BDD tests should be integrated with the CI pipeline
