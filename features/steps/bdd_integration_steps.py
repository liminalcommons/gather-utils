# Portal Explorer BDD Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Portal Explorer features and requirements,
as documented through Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) scenarios.

## Features

### Portal Functionality

The Portal Explorer can extract and analyze portal information from Gather.town maps.

Scenarios:
- Extract portal information from a map file
- Identify portal connections between maps
- Handle maps without portals

### Portal Explorer Service

The Portal Explorer service provides a high-level API for analyzing portals.

Scenarios:
- Initialize the Portal Explorer service
- Analyze portals in a specific map
- Analyze portals across all maps
- Generate a connection graph

### Command Line Interface

The Portal Explorer CLI provides a command-line interface for the service.

Scenarios:
- Set up the CLI framework
- List maps in a space
- Explore portals in a specific map
- Explore portals across all maps
- Handle API errors
- Format output with rich tables
