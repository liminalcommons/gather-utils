@implementation @portal-model
Feature: Portal Data Model Implementation
  As a Developer
  I want to implement a robust portal data model
  So that the system can reliably process portal data

  Background:
    Given I have the Portal Explorer codebase
    And I have the necessary dependencies installed

  # Model structure
  @REQ-4.1 @model-creation
  Scenario: Creating a Portal model instance
    Given I have a valid portal data structure
    When I create a Portal model instance
    Then the Portal model should have the correct attributes
    And the Portal model should be valid

  @REQ-4.2 @model-validation
  Scenario: Validating Portal model
    Given I have a Portal model instance
    When I check if the Portal is valid
    Then it should return True for valid portals
    And it should return False for invalid portals

  @REQ-4.3 @model-destination
  Scenario: Getting Portal destination
    Given I have a Portal model instance
    When I get the destination of the Portal
    Then it should return the correct destination map and coordinates

  @REQ-4.4 @model-serialization
  Scenario: Converting Portal to dictionary
    Given I have a Portal model instance
    When I convert the Portal to a dictionary
    Then the dictionary should contain all Portal information

  # Portal extraction
  @REQ-4.5 @extraction
  Scenario: Extract Portals from a Map
    Given I have a GatherClient instance
    When I call the get_portals method for a specific map
    Then it should return a list of portal objects
    And each portal should have the correct properties
    And portals should be filtered from other object types

  @REQ-4.6 @extraction @test-script
  Scenario: Create portal testing script
    Given I have a test script for portal extraction
    When I run the script against real map data
    Then it should correctly identify all portals
    And it should parse portal properties accurately
    And it should handle different portal configurations

  # Portal connections
  @REQ-4.7 @connections
  Scenario: Analyze Portal Connections Between Maps
    Given I have portal data from multiple maps
    When I analyze the portal connections
    Then it should identify bidirectional portals
    And it should create a connection graph between maps
    And it should detect orphaned or one-way portals

  # Data structuring
  @REQ-4.8 @structured-data
  Scenario: Generate Structured Portal Data
    Given I have completed portal analysis
    When I save the results to JSON
    Then the output should have a structured format
    And it should include all portal information
    And it should be saved to the specified output directory

  # Unit testing
  @REQ-4.9 @testing
  Scenario: Unit Tests for Portal Functionality
    Given I have unit tests for the portal object model
    And I have unit tests for portal extraction
    When I run the test suite
    Then all tests should pass
    And the tests should cover edge cases
    And the tests should verify portal property validation
