@implementation @portal-service
Feature: Portal Explorer Service Implementation
  As a Developer
  I want to implement the portal explorer service
  So that the system can analyze and explore portals effectively

  Background:
    Given I have the Portal Explorer codebase
    And I have the necessary dependencies installed

  # Service initialization
  @REQ-5.1 @service-creation
  Scenario: Create PortalExplorer Class
    Given I need to analyze portal structures
    When I create a PortalExplorer class
    Then it should initialize with a client and output directory
    And it should have the basic structure for portal analysis

  # Single map analysis
  @REQ-5.2 @map-analysis
  Scenario: Implement Map Portal Analysis
    Given I have a PortalExplorer instance
    When I call the analyze_map_portals method for a specific map
    Then it should extract all portals from the map
    And it should analyze the portal data
    And it should return structured portal information

  # Multi-map analysis
  @REQ-5.3 @multi-map-analysis
  Scenario: Implement Multi-Map Analysis
    Given I have a PortalExplorer instance
    When I call the analyze_all_maps method
    Then it should process all maps in the space
    And it should aggregate portal data across maps
    And it should return comprehensive portal information for the entire space

  # Connection analysis
  @REQ-5.4 @connection-analysis
  Scenario: Implement Connection Analysis
    Given I have portal data from multiple maps
    When I analyze the portal connections
    Then it should identify bidirectional portals
    And it should create a connection graph between maps
    And it should detect orphaned or one-way portals

  # Result storage
  @REQ-5.5 @result-output
  Scenario: Add Result Output Generation
    Given I have completed portal analysis
    When I save the results to JSON
    Then the output should have a structured format
    And it should include all portal information
    And it should be saved to the specified output directory

  # Service integration
  @REQ-5.6 @service-integration
  Scenario: Portal Explorer Service Integration
    Given I need to analyze portal structures
    And I have a GatherClient instance
    When I integrate the PortalExplorer service with the client
    Then I should be able to analyze portals using a high-level API
    And the service should handle all the details of portal analysis
    And the service should provide consistent results across different maps
