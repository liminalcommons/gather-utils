Feature: Development System Verification
  As a project stakeholder
  I want to verify our development system meets quality standards
  So that we can ensure no redundancy, clear evolveability, and clear operability

  Background:
    Given we have an existing development system
    And we have agent and project systems in place

  # Documentation verification

    Then it should confirm the codebase is free of critical redundancies
    And any identified redundancies should be properly categorized by impact
    And there should be a prioritized plan for any needed resolutions

  @REQ-9.3 @system-map @REL-1
  Scenario: Verify Development System Map Accuracy
    When I examine the development system map
    Then it should accurately reflect all system components and relationships
    And it should identify key navigation points for agents
    And it should match the actual repository structure

  # Structure verification
  @REQ-9.4 @structure @testing @REL-2
  Scenario: Verify Testing Directory Structure
    When I inspect the testing directory organization
    Then all testing components should be properly organized
    And there should be no duplicated test functionality
    And all tests should execute successfully in the unified structure

  @REQ-9.5 @structure @documentation @REL-2
  Scenario: Verify Documentation Centralization
    When I review the documentation structure
    Then all documentation should be centrally accessible
    And the documentation structure should follow project standards
    And all required documentation components should be present

  @REQ-9.6 @structure @tools @REL-2
  Scenario: Verify Tool Documentation Completeness
    When I examine the tool documentation
    Then it should comprehensively document all development tools
    And documentation should include complete usage examples
    And instructions should be clear and standardized

  # Automation verification
  @REQ-9.7 @automation @pre-commit @REL-3
  Scenario: Verify Pre-commit Hook Effectiveness
    When I attempt to commit code with common issues
    Then the pre-commit hooks should detect and block the issues
    And helpful error messages should guide resolution
    And the pre-commit hooks should be properly documented

  @REQ-9.8 @automation @health-checks @REL-3
  Scenario: Verify Repository Health Check Coverage
    When I execute the repository health checks
    Then they should verify all critical aspects of repository health
    And health reports should provide actionable insights
    And health checks should be properly documented

  @REQ-9.9 @automation @cli @REL-3
  Scenario: Verify Development CLI Functionality
    When I use the development task CLI
    Then it should provide access to all required development tasks
    And commands should work as documented
    And documentation should cover all available commands

  # Agent support verification
  @REQ-9.10 @agent @file-structure @REL-4
  Scenario: Verify File Structure Convention Compliance
    When I inspect the repository structure
    Then it should comply with documented file structure conventions
    And conventions should be clearly documented
    And documentation should include practical examples

  @REQ-9.11 @agent @documentation @REL-4
  Scenario: Verify Agent Documentation Completeness
    When I review the agent-specific documentation
    Then it should comprehensively cover agent interaction patterns
    And it should be integrated with the main documentation
    And it should provide all information agents need to navigate the codebase

  @REQ-9.12 @agent @validation @REL-4
  Scenario: Verify Repository Structure Validation
    When I run the repository structure validation
    Then it should verify compliance with structure standards
    And it should generate accurate validation reports
    And reports should highlight any compliance issues

  @REQ-9.13 @agent @navigation @REL-4
  Scenario: Verify Agent Navigation Capabilities
    When I test agent codebase navigation
    Then agents should successfully navigate all key parts of the codebase
    And navigation paths should be efficient and intuitive
    And navigation test reports should show full coverage
